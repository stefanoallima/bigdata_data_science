                    1&#39;,\n &#39;  From fairest creatures we desire increase,&#39;,\n &#34;  That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die,&#34;,\n &#39;  But as the riper should by time decease,&#39;,\n &#39;  His tender heir might bear his memory:&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,&#39;,\n &#34;  Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&#34;,\n &#39;  Making a famine where abundance lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament,&#34;,\n &#39;  And only herald to the gaudy spring,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,&#39;,\n &#34;  And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding:&#34;,\n &#39;    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,&#39;,\n &#34;    To eat the world&#39;s due, by the grave and thee.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     2&#39;,\n &#39;  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,&#39;,\n &#34;  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field,&#34;,\n &#34;  Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;&#39;,\n &#39;  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.&#39;,\n &#34;  How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use,&#34;,\n &#34;  If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34;  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  Proving his beauty by succession thine.&#39;,\n &#39;    This were to be new made when thou art old,&#39;,\n &#34;    And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     3&#39;,\n &#39;  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Now is the time that face should form another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.&#39;,\n &#39;  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39;  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?&#39;,\n &#39;  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of his self-love to stop posterity?&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39;  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,&#39;,\n &#39;  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,&#39;,\n &#39;  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if thou live remembered not to be,&#39;,\n &#39;    Die single and thine image dies with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     4&#39;,\n &#39;  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,&#39;,\n &#34;  Upon thy self thy beauty&#39;s legacy?&#34;,\n &#34;  Nature&#39;s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,&#34;,\n &#39;  And being frank she lends to those are free:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,&#39;,\n &#39;  The bounteous largess given thee to give?&#39;,\n &#39;  Profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39;  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?&#39;,\n &#39;  For having traffic with thy self alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?&#39;,\n &#39;    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,&#39;,\n &#34;    Which used lives th&#39; executor to be.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     5&#39;,\n &#39;  Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;  Will play the tyrants to the very same,&#39;,\n &#39;  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:&#39;,\n &#39;  For never-resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;  To hideous winter and confounds him there,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty o&#39;er-snowed and bareness every where:&#34;,\n &#34;  Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39;  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.&#39;,\n &#39;    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,&#39;,\n &#39;    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     6&#39;,\n &#34;  Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface,&#34;,\n &#39;  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:&#39;,\n &#39;  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,&#39;,\n &#34;  With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self-killed:&#34;,\n &#39;  That use is not forbidden usury,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;&#39;,\n &#34;  That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,&#39;,\n &#39;  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Leaving thee living in posterity?&#39;,\n &#39;    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,&#39;,\n &#34;    To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     7&#39;,\n &#39;  Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,&#39;,\n &#39;  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,&#39;,\n &#39;  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:&#39;,\n &#39;  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,&#39;,\n &#39;  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;  From his low tract and look another way:&#39;,\n &#39;    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:&#39;,\n &#39;    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     8&#39;,\n &#34;  Music to hear, why hear&#39;st thou music sadly?&#34;,\n &#39;  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:&#39;,\n &#34;  Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly,&#34;,\n &#34;  Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy?&#34;,\n &#39;  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,&#39;,\n &#39;  By unions married do offend thine ear,&#39;,\n &#39;  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:&#39;,\n &#39;  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:&#39;,\n &#39;    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,&#39;,\n &#34;    Sings this to thee, &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     9&#39;,\n &#34;  Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#34;  That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life?&#34;,\n &#39;  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will be thy widow and still weep,&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,&#39;,\n &#39;  When every private widow well may keep,&#39;,\n &#34;  By children&#39;s eyes, her husband&#39;s shape in mind:&#34;,\n &#39;  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;&#39;,\n &#34;  But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end,&#34;,\n &#39;  And kept unused the user so destroys it:&#39;,\n &#39;    No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34;    That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     10&#39;,\n &#34;  For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39;  Who for thy self art so unprovident.&#39;,\n &#39;  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,&#39;,\n &#34;  But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident:&#34;,\n &#34;  For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate,&#34;,\n &#34;  That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire,&#34;,\n &#39;  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:&#39;,\n &#39;  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,&#39;,\n &#39;    Make thee another self for love of me,&#39;,\n &#39;    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     11&#39;,\n &#34;  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,&#39;,\n &#34;  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  If all were minded so, the times should cease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And threescore year would make the world away:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,&#39;,\n &#39;  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:&#39;,\n &#39;  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;&#39;,\n &#39;  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:&#39;,\n &#39;    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     12&#39;,\n &#39;  When I do count the clock that tells the time,&#39;,\n &#39;  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I behold the violet past prime,&#39;,\n &#34;  And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white:&#34;,\n &#39;  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39;  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou among the wastes of time must go,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,&#39;,\n &#39;  And die as fast as they see others grow,&#39;,\n &#34;    And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39;    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     13&#39;,\n &#39;  O that you were your self, but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;  No longer yours, than you your self here live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against this coming end you should prepare,&#39;,\n &#39;  And your sweet semblance to some other give.&#39;,\n &#39;  So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;  Find no determination, then you were&#39;,\n &#34;  Your self again after your self&#39;s decease,&#34;,\n &#39;  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,&#39;,\n &#34;  Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34;  And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold?&#34;,\n &#39;    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,&#39;,\n &#39;    You had a father, let your son say so.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     14&#39;,\n &#39;  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet methinks I have astronomy,&#39;,\n &#39;  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,&#39;,\n &#34;  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#39; quality,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;&#39;,\n &#39;  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;  By oft predict that I in heaven find.&#39;,\n &#39;  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,&#39;,\n &#39;  And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39;  As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:&#39;,\n &#39;    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     15&#39;,\n &#39;  When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;  Holds in perfection but a little moment.&#39;,\n &#39;  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.&#39;,\n &#39;  When I perceive that men as plants increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:&#39;,\n &#39;  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And wear their brave state out of memory.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;  To change your day of youth to sullied night,&#39;,\n &#39;    And all in war with Time for love of you,&#39;,\n &#39;    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     16&#39;,\n &#39;  But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?&#39;,\n &#39;  And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?&#39;,\n &#39;  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,&#39;,\n &#39;  And many maiden gardens yet unset,&#39;,\n &#39;  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,&#39;,\n &#39;  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:&#39;,\n &#39;  So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34;  Which this (Time&#39;s pencil) or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39;  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.&#39;,\n &#39;    To give away your self, keeps your self still,&#39;,\n &#39;    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     17&#39;,\n &#39;  Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;  If it were filled with your most high deserts?&#39;,\n &#39;  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:&#39;,\n &#39;  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,&#39;,\n &#39;  The age to come would say this poet lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces.&#34;,\n &#39;  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)&#39;,\n &#39;  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,&#39;,\n &#34;  And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage,&#34;,\n &#39;  And stretched metre of an antique song.&#39;,\n &#39;    But were some child of yours alive that time,&#39;,\n &#39;    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     18&#39;,\n &#34;  Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day?&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:&#39;,\n &#39;  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date:&#34;,\n &#39;  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,&#39;,\n &#39;  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair from fair sometime declines,&#39;,\n &#34;  By chance, or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed:&#34;,\n &#39;  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade,&#34;,\n &#34;  When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,&#39;,\n &#39;    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     19&#39;,\n &#34;  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift-footed Time&#34;,\n &#39;  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:&#39;,\n &#39;  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,&#39;,\n &#34;  O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Him in thy course untainted do allow,&#39;,\n &#34;  For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men.&#34;,\n &#39;    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,&#39;,\n &#39;    My love shall in my verse ever live young.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     20&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted,&#34;,\n &#39;  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34;  With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion,&#34;,\n &#39;  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,&#39;,\n &#39;  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth.&#34;,\n &#39;  And for a woman wert thou first created,&#39;,\n &#39;  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by addition me of thee defeated,&#39;,\n &#39;  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.&#39;,\n &#34;    But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure,&#34;,\n &#34;    Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     21&#39;,\n &#39;  So is it not with me as with that muse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34;  With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems:&#34;,\n &#34;  With April&#39;s first-born flowers and all things rare,&#34;,\n &#34;  That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems.&#34;,\n &#39;  O let me true in love but truly write,&#39;,\n &#39;  And then believe me, my love is as fair,&#39;,\n &#34;  As any mother&#39;s child, though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34;  As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air:&#34;,\n &#39;    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,&#39;,\n &#39;    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     22&#39;,\n &#39;  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,&#39;,\n &#39;  So long as youth and thou are of one date,&#39;,\n &#34;  But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold,&#34;,\n &#39;  Then look I death my days should expiate.&#39;,\n &#39;  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then be elder than thou art?&#39;,\n &#39;  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,&#39;,\n &#39;  As I not for my self, but for thee will,&#39;,\n &#39;  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.&#39;,\n &#39;    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     23&#39;,\n &#39;  As an unperfect actor on the stage,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who with his fear is put beside his part,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,&#39;,\n &#34;  Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart;&#34;,\n &#39;  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,&#39;,\n &#34;  The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite,&#34;,\n &#34;  And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay,&#34;,\n &#34;  O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might:&#34;,\n &#39;  O let my looks be then the eloquence,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,&#39;,\n &#39;  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.&#39;,\n &#39;    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,&#39;,\n &#34;    To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     24&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart,&#34;,\n &#34;  My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held,&#34;,\n &#34;  And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art.&#34;,\n &#39;  For through the painter must you see his skill,&#39;,\n &#39;  To find where your true image pictured lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still,&#34;,\n &#39;  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:&#39;,\n &#39;  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun&#39;,\n &#39;  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,&#39;,\n &#39;    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     25&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those who are in favour with their stars,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of public honour and proud titles boast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;&#39;,\n &#34;  Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread,&#34;,\n &#34;  But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in themselves their pride lies buried,&#39;,\n &#39;  For at a frown they in their glory die.&#39;,\n &#39;  The painful warrior famoused for fight,&#39;,\n &#39;  After a thousand victories once foiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is from the book of honour razed quite,&#39;,\n &#39;  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:&#39;,\n &#39;    Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;    Where I may not remove nor be removed.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     26&#39;,\n &#39;  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;&#39;,\n &#39;  To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;  To witness duty, not to show my wit.&#39;,\n &#39;  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;&#39;,\n &#39;  But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34;  In thy soul&#39;s thought (all naked) will bestow it:&#34;,\n &#39;  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,&#39;,\n &#39;  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,&#39;,\n &#39;  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,&#39;,\n &#39;  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,&#39;,\n &#39;    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     27&#39;,\n &#39;  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,&#39;,\n &#39;  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,&#39;,\n &#39;  But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34;  To work my mind, when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired.&#34;,\n &#39;  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)&#39;,\n &#39;  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.&#39;,\n &#34;  Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39;  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)&#39;,\n &#39;  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.&#39;,\n &#39;    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     28&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;  That am debarred the benefit of rest?&#39;,\n &#34;  When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night,&#34;,\n &#39;  But day by night and night by day oppressed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And each (though enemies to either&#39;s reign)&#34;,\n &#39;  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one by toil, the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.&#39;,\n &#39;  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:&#39;,\n &#39;  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,&#39;,\n &#34;  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even.&#34;,\n &#39;    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,&#39;,\n &#34;    And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     29&#39;,\n &#34;  When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes,&#34;,\n &#39;  I all alone beweep my outcast state,&#39;,\n &#39;  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,&#39;,\n &#39;  And look upon my self and curse my fate,&#39;,\n &#39;  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,&#39;,\n &#39;  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,&#39;,\n &#34;  Desiring this man&#39;s art, and that man&#39;s scope,&#34;,\n &#39;  With what I most enjoy contented least,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,&#39;,\n &#39;  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,&#39;,\n &#39;  (Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34;  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate,&#34;,\n &#39;    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,&#39;,\n &#39;    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     30&#39;,\n &#39;  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  I summon up remembrance of things past,&#39;,\n &#39;  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,&#39;,\n &#34;  And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste:&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)&#39;,\n &#34;  For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night,&#34;,\n &#34;  And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe,&#34;,\n &#34;  And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight.&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,&#39;,\n &#34;  And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39;  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I new pay as if not paid before.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)&#39;,\n &#39;    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     31&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,&#39;,\n &#34;  And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts,&#34;,\n &#39;  And all those friends which I thought buried.&#39;,\n &#39;  How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34;  Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  As interest of the dead, which now appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That due of many, now is thine alone.&#39;,\n &#39;    Their images I loved, I view in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     32&#39;,\n &#39;  If thou survive my well-contented day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey&#39;,\n &#39;  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:&#39;,\n &#34;  Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time,&#34;,\n &#39;  And though they be outstripped by every pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  Exceeded by the height of happier men.&#39;,\n &#39;  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age,&#34;,\n &#39;  A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;  To march in ranks of better equipage:&#39;,\n &#39;    But since he died and poets better prove,&#39;,\n &#34;    Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read, his for his love&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     33&#39;,\n &#39;  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:&#39;,\n &#39;  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,&#39;,\n &#39;  With ugly rack on his celestial face,&#39;,\n &#39;  And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,&#39;,\n &#39;  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,&#39;,\n &#39;  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,&#39;,\n &#39;  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,&#39;,\n &#34;    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven&#39;s sun staineth.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     34&#39;,\n &#39;  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,&#39;,\n &#39;  And make me travel forth without my cloak,&#39;,\n &#34;  To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way,&#34;,\n &#34;  Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke?&#34;,\n &#34;  &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,&#34;,\n &#39;  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,&#39;,\n &#39;  For no man well of such a salve can speak,&#39;,\n &#39;  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34;  To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross.&#34;,\n &#39;    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,&#39;,\n &#39;    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     35&#39;,\n &#39;  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,&#39;,\n &#39;  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,&#39;,\n &#39;  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.&#39;,\n &#39;  All men make faults, and even I in this,&#39;,\n &#39;  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,&#39;,\n &#39;  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:&#39;,\n &#39;  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,&#39;,\n &#34;  And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence:&#34;,\n &#39;  Such civil war is in my love and hate,&#39;,\n &#39;    That I an accessary needs must be,&#39;,\n &#39;    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     36&#39;,\n &#39;  Let me confess that we two must be twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Although our undivided loves are one:&#39;,\n &#39;  So shall those blots that do with me remain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.&#39;,\n &#39;  In our two loves there is but one respect,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though in our lives a separable spite,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect,&#34;,\n &#34;  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:&#39;,\n &#39;    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,&#39;,\n &#39;    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     37&#39;,\n &#39;  As a decrepit father takes delight,&#39;,\n &#39;  To see his active child do deeds of youth,&#39;,\n &#34;  So I, made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39;  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.&#39;,\n &#39;  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or any of these all, or all, or more&#39;,\n &#39;  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,&#39;,\n &#39;  I make my love engrafted to this store:&#39;,\n &#39;  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by a part of all thy glory live:&#39;,\n &#39;    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     38&#39;,\n &#39;  How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34;  While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,&#39;,\n &#39;  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?&#39;,\n &#39;  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  When thou thy self dost give invention light?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,&#39;,\n &#39;  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.&#39;,\n &#39;    If my slight muse do please these curious days,&#39;,\n &#39;    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     39&#39;,\n &#39;  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,&#39;,\n &#39;  When thou art all the better part of me?&#39;,\n &#39;  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:&#39;,\n &#34;  And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee?&#34;,\n &#39;  Even for this, let us divided live,&#39;,\n &#39;  And our dear love lose name of single one,&#39;,\n &#39;  That by this separation I may give:&#39;,\n &#34;  That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone:&#34;,\n &#39;  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,&#39;,\n &#39;  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.&#39;,\n &#39;    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,&#39;,\n &#39;    By praising him here who doth hence remain.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     40&#39;,\n &#39;  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,&#39;,\n &#39;  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?&#39;,\n &#39;  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,&#39;,\n &#39;  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,&#39;,\n &#39;  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,&#39;,\n &#39;  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.&#39;,\n &#39;  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34;  To bear greater wrong, than hate&#39;s known injury.&#34;,\n &#39;    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,&#39;,\n &#39;    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     41&#39;,\n &#39;  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,&#39;,\n &#39;  For still temptation follows where thou art.&#39;,\n &#39;  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,&#39;,\n &#39;  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And when a woman woos, what woman&#39;s son,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?&#39;,\n &#39;  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:&#39;,\n &#39;    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     42&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,&#39;,\n &#39;  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,&#39;,\n &#39;  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.&#39;,\n &#39;  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou dost love her, because thou know&#39;st I love her,&#34;,\n &#39;  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,&#39;,\n &#34;  Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her.&#34;,\n &#34;  If I lose thee, my loss is my love&#39;s gain,&#34;,\n &#39;  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,&#39;,\n &#34;    But here&#39;s the joy, my friend and I are one,&#34;,\n &#39;    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     43&#39;,\n &#39;  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,&#39;,\n &#39;  For all the day they view things unrespected,&#39;,\n &#39;  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34;  How would thy shadow&#39;s form, form happy show,&#34;,\n &#39;  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,&#39;,\n &#39;  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!&#39;,\n &#39;  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,&#39;,\n &#39;  By looking on thee in the living day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!&#39;,\n &#39;    All days are nights to see till I see thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     44&#39;,\n &#39;  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Injurious distance should not stop my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  For then despite of space I would be brought,&#39;,\n &#39;  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,&#39;,\n &#39;  As soon as think the place where he would be.&#39;,\n &#39;  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  But that so much of earth and water wrought,&#39;,\n &#34;  I must attend, time&#39;s leisure with my moan.&#34;,\n &#39;    Receiving nought by elements so slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    But heavy tears, badges of either&#39;s woe.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     45&#39;,\n &#39;  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,&#39;,\n &#39;  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,&#39;,\n &#39;  The first my thought, the other my desire,&#39;,\n &#39;  These present-absent with swift motion slide.&#39;,\n &#39;  For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;  In tender embassy of love to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  My life being made of four, with two alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.&#39;,\n &#34;  Until life&#39;s composition be recured,&#34;,\n &#39;  By those swift messengers returned from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who even but now come back again assured,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.&#39;,\n &#39;    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,&#39;,\n &#39;    I send them back again and straight grow sad.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     46&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,&#39;,\n &#39;  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  Mine eye, my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar,&#34;,\n &#39;  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,&#39;,\n &#39;  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,&#39;,\n &#39;  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)&#39;,\n &#39;  But the defendant doth that plea deny,&#39;,\n &#39;  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.&#39;,\n &#39;  To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34;  The clear eye&#39;s moiety, and the dear heart&#39;s part.&#34;,\n &#34;    As thus, mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part,&#34;,\n &#34;    And my heart&#39;s right, thy inward love of heart.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     47&#39;,\n &#39;  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,&#39;,\n &#39;  And each doth good turns now unto the other,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that mine eye is famished for a look,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;&#39;,\n &#34;  With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast,&#34;,\n &#39;  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:&#39;,\n &#34;  Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.&#39;,\n &#39;  So either by thy picture or my love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self away, art present still with me,&#39;,\n &#39;  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,&#39;,\n &#39;  And I am still with them, and they with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34;    Awakes my heart, to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     48&#39;,\n &#39;  How careful was I when I took my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,&#39;,\n &#39;  That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,&#39;,\n &#39;  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the gentle closure of my breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,&#39;,\n &#34;    And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear,&#34;,\n &#39;    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     49&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time (if ever that time come)&#39;,\n &#39;  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,&#39;,\n &#39;  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,&#39;,\n &#39;  Called to that audit by advised respects,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,&#39;,\n &#39;  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  When love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time do I ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,&#39;,\n &#39;  And this my hand, against my self uprear,&#39;,\n &#39;  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,&#39;,\n &#39;    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,&#39;,\n &#39;    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     50&#39;,\n &#39;  How heavy do I journey on the way,&#39;,\n &#34;  When what I seek (my weary travel&#39;s end)&#34;,\n &#39;  Doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,&#39;,\n &#39;  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  As if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,&#39;,\n &#39;  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which heavily he answers with a groan,&#39;,\n &#39;  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,&#39;,\n &#39;    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     51&#39;,\n &#39;  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,&#39;,\n &#39;  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?&#39;,\n &#39;  Till I return of posting is no need.&#39;,\n &#39;  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,&#39;,\n &#39;  When swift extremity can seem but slow?&#39;,\n &#39;  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  In winged speed no motion shall I know,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,&#39;,\n &#34;  Therefore desire (of perfect&#39;st love being made)&#34;,\n &#39;  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,&#39;,\n &#39;  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,&#39;,\n &#39;    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    Towards thee I&#39;ll run, and give him leave to go.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     52&#39;,\n &#39;  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,&#39;,\n &#39;  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,&#39;,\n &#39;  The which he will not every hour survey,&#39;,\n &#39;  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.&#39;,\n &#39;  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since seldom coming in that long year set,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.&#39;,\n &#39;  So is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,&#39;,\n &#39;  To make some special instant special-blest,&#39;,\n &#39;  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.&#39;,\n &#39;    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,&#39;,\n &#39;    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     53&#39;,\n &#39;  What is your substance, whereof are you made,&#39;,\n &#39;  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?&#39;,\n &#39;  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  And you but one, can every shadow lend:&#39;,\n &#39;  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is poorly imitated after you,&#39;,\n &#34;  On Helen&#39;s cheek all art of beauty set,&#34;,\n &#39;  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:&#39;,\n &#39;  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,&#39;,\n &#39;  The other as your bounty doth appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And you in every blessed shape we know.&#39;,\n &#39;    In all external grace you have some part,&#39;,\n &#39;    But you like none, none you for constant heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     54&#39;,\n &#39;  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,&#39;,\n &#39;  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!&#39;,\n &#39;  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:&#39;,\n &#39;  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,&#39;,\n &#39;  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,&#39;,\n &#34;  When summer&#39;s breath their masked buds discloses:&#34;,\n &#39;  But for their virtue only is their show,&#39;,\n &#39;  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:&#39;,\n &#39;    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,&#39;,\n &#39;    When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     55&#39;,\n &#39;  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  But you shall shine more bright in these contents&#39;,\n &#39;  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.&#39;,\n &#39;  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,&#39;,\n &#39;  And broils root out the work of masonry,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor Mars his sword, nor war&#39;s quick fire shall burn:&#34;,\n &#39;  The living record of your memory.&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity&#34;,\n &#39;  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,&#39;,\n &#39;  Even in the eyes of all posterity&#39;,\n &#39;  That wear this world out to the ending doom.&#39;,\n &#39;    So till the judgment that your self arise,&#39;,\n &#34;    You live in this, and dwell in lovers&#39; eyes.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     56&#39;,\n &#39;  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,&#39;,\n &#39;  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.&#39;,\n &#39;  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,&#39;,\n &#39;  To-morrow see again, and do not kill&#39;,\n &#39;  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let this sad interim like the ocean be&#39;,\n &#39;  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,&#39;,\n &#39;  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:&#39;,\n &#39;  Return of love, more blest may be the view.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or call it winter, which being full of care,&#39;,\n &#34;    Makes summer&#39;s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     57&#39;,\n &#39;  Being your slave what should I do but tend,&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?&#39;,\n &#39;  I have no precious time at all to spend;&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor services to do till you require.&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,&#39;,\n &#39;  When you have bid your servant once adieu.&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,&#39;,\n &#39;  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where you are, how happy you make those.&#39;,\n &#39;    So true a fool is love, that in your will,&#39;,\n &#39;    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     58&#39;,\n &#39;  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,&#39;,\n &#39;  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,&#39;,\n &#34;  Or at your hand th&#39; account of hours to crave,&#34;,\n &#39;  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.&#39;,\n &#39;  O let me suffer (being at your beck)&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; imprisoned absence of your liberty,&#34;,\n &#39;  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without accusing you of injury.&#39;,\n &#39;  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,&#39;,\n &#39;  That you your self may privilage your time&#39;,\n &#39;  To what you will, to you it doth belong,&#39;,\n &#39;  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.&#39;,\n &#39;    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,&#39;,\n &#39;    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     59&#39;,\n &#39;  If there be nothing new, but that which is,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which labouring for invention bear amis&#39;,\n &#39;  The second burthen of a former child!&#39;,\n &#39;  O that record could with a backward look,&#39;,\n ...]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[8]: [&#39;1609&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE SONNETS&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;by William Shakespeare&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     1&#39;,\n &#39;  From fairest creatures we desire increase,&#39;,\n &#34;  That thereby beauty&#39;s rose might never die,&#34;,\n &#39;  But as the riper should by time decease,&#39;,\n &#39;  His tender heir might bear his memory:&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,&#39;,\n &#34;  Feed&#39;st thy light&#39;s flame with self-substantial fuel,&#34;,\n &#39;  Making a famine where abundance lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou that art now the world&#39;s fresh ornament,&#34;,\n &#39;  And only herald to the gaudy spring,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,&#39;,\n &#34;  And tender churl mak&#39;st waste in niggarding:&#34;,\n &#39;    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,&#39;,\n &#34;    To eat the world&#39;s due, by the grave and thee.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     2&#39;,\n &#39;  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,&#39;,\n &#34;  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#39;s field,&#34;,\n &#34;  Thy youth&#39;s proud livery so gazed on now,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;&#39;,\n &#39;  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.&#39;,\n &#34;  How much more praise deserved thy beauty&#39;s use,&#34;,\n &#34;  If thou couldst answer &#39;This fair child of mine&#34;,\n &#34;  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  Proving his beauty by succession thine.&#39;,\n &#39;    This were to be new made when thou art old,&#39;,\n &#34;    And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#39;st it cold.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     3&#39;,\n &#39;  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Now is the time that face should form another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,&#39;,\n &#39;

 Of his self-love to stop posterity?&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou art thy mother&#39;s glass and she in thee&#34;,\n &#39;  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,&#39;,\n &#39;  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,&#39;,\n &#39;

 So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?&#39;,\n &#39;  For having traffic with thy self alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?&#39;,\n &#39;    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,&#39;,\n &#34;    Which used lives th&#39; executor to be.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     5&#39;,\n &#39;  Those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;  Will play the tyrants to the very same,&#39;,\n &#39;  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:&#39;,\n &#39;  For never-resting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;  To hideous winter and confounds him there,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty o&#39;er-snowed and bareness every where:&#34;,\n &#34;  Then were not summer&#39;s distillation left&#34;,\n &#39;  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,&#39;,\n &#34;  Beauty&#39;s effect with beauty were bereft,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.&#39;,\n &#39;    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,&#39;,\n &#39;    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     6&#39;,\n &#34;  Then let not winter&#39;s ragged hand deface,&#34;,\n &#39;  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:&#39;,\n &#39;  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,&#39;,\n &#34;  With beauty&#39;s treasure ere it be self-killed:&#34;,\n &#39;  That use is not forbidden usury,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;&#39;,\n &#34;  That&#39;s for thy self to breed another thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,&#39;,\n &#39;  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Leaving thee living in posterity?&#39;,\n &#39;    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,&#39;,\n &#34;    To be death&#39;s conquest and make worms thine heir.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     7&#39;,\n &#39;  Lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,&#39;,\n &#39;  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,&#39;,\n &#39;  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:&#39;,\n &#39;  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,&#39;,\n &#39;  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;  From his low tract and look another way:&#39;,\n &#39;    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:&#39;,\n &#39;    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     8&#39;,\n &#34;  Music to hear, why hear&#39;st thou music sadly?&#34;,\n &#39;  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:&#39;,\n &#34;  Why lov&#39;st thou that which thou receiv&#39;st not gladly,&#34;,\n &#34;  Or else receiv&#39;st with pleasure thine annoy?&#34;,\n &#39;  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,&#39;,\n &#39;  By unions married do offend thine ear,&#39;,\n &#39;  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:&#39;,\n &#39;  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,&#39;,\n &#39;  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;&#39;,\n &#39;  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:&#39;,\n &#39;    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,&#39;,\n &#34;    Sings this to thee, &#39;Thou single wilt prove none&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     9&#39;,\n &#34;  Is it for fear to wet a widow&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#34;  That thou consum&#39;st thy self in single life?&#34;,\n &#39;  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,&#39;,\n &#39;  The world will be thy widow and still weep,&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,&#39;,\n &#39;  When every private widow well may keep,&#39;,\n &#34;  By children&#39;s eyes, her husband&#39;s shape in mind:&#34;,\n &#39;  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;&#39;,\n &#34;  But beauty&#39;s waste hath in the world an end,&#34;,\n &#39;  And kept unused the user so destroys it:&#39;,\n &#39;    No love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#34;    That on himself such murd&#39;rous shame commits.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     10&#39;,\n &#34;  For shame deny that thou bear&#39;st love to any&#34;,\n &#39;  Who for thy self art so unprovident.&#39;,\n &#39;  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,&#39;,\n &#34;  But that thou none lov&#39;st is most evident:&#34;,\n &#34;  For thou art so possessed with murd&#39;rous hate,&#34;,\n &#34;  That &#39;gainst thy self thou stick&#39;st not to conspire,&#34;,\n &#39;  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:&#39;,\n &#39;  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,&#39;,\n &#39;    Make thee another self for love of me,&#39;,\n &#39;    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     11&#39;,\n &#34;  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,&#39;,\n &#34;  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  If all were minded so, the times should cease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And threescore year would make the world away:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,&#39;,\n &#39;  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:&#39;,\n &#39;  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;&#39;,\n &#39;  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:&#39;,\n &#39;    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     12&#39;,\n &#39;  When I do count the clock that tells the time,&#39;,\n &#39;  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I behold the violet past prime,&#39;,\n &#34;  And sable curls all silvered o&#39;er with white:&#34;,\n &#39;  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s green all girded up in sheaves&#34;,\n &#39;  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then of thy beauty do I question make&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou among the wastes of time must go,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,&#39;,\n &#39;  And die as fast as they see others grow,&#39;,\n &#34;    And nothing &#39;gainst Time&#39;s scythe can make defence&#34;,\n &#39;    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     13&#39;,\n &#39;  O that you were your self, but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;  No longer yours, than you your self here live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against this coming end you should prepare,&#39;,\n &#39;  And your sweet semblance to some other give.&#39;,\n &#39;  So should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;  Find no determination, then you were&#39;,\n &#34;  Your self again after your self&#39;s decease,&#34;,\n &#39;  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,&#39;,\n &#34;  Against the stormy gusts of winter&#39;s day&#34;,\n &#34;  And barren rage of death&#39;s eternal cold?&#34;,\n &#39;    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,&#39;,\n &#39;    You had a father, let your son say so.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     14&#39;,\n &#39;  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet methinks I have astronomy,&#39;,\n &#39;  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,&#39;,\n &#34;  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#39; quality,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;&#39;,\n &#39;  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;  By oft predict that I in heaven find.&#39;,\n &#39;  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,&#39;,\n &#39;  And constant stars in them I read such art&#39;,\n &#39;  As truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:&#39;,\n &#39;    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thy end is truth&#39;s and beauty&#39;s doom and date.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     15&#39;,\n &#39;  When I consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;  Holds in perfection but a little moment.&#39;,\n &#39;  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.&#39;,\n &#39;  When I perceive that men as plants increase,&#39;,\n &#39;  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:&#39;,\n &#39;  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,&#39;,\n &#39;  And wear their brave state out of memory.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;  To change your day of youth to sullied night,&#39;,\n &#39;    And all in war with Time for love of you,&#39;,\n &#39;    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     16&#39;,\n &#39;  But wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?&#39;,\n &#39;  And fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?&#39;,\n &#39;  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,&#39;,\n &#39;  And many maiden gardens yet unset,&#39;,\n &#39;  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,&#39;,\n &#39;  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:&#39;,\n &#39;  So should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#34;  Which this (Time&#39;s pencil) or my pupil pen&#34;,\n &#39;  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.&#39;,\n &#39;    To give away your self, keeps your self still,&#39;,\n &#39;    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     17&#39;,\n &#39;  Who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;  If it were filled with your most high deserts?&#39;,\n &#39;  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:&#39;,\n &#39;  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,&#39;,\n &#39;  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,&#39;,\n &#39;  The age to come would say this poet lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces.&#34;,\n &#39;  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)&#39;,\n &#39;  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,&#39;,\n &#34;  And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage,&#34;,\n &#39;  And stretched metre of an antique song.&#39;,\n &#39;    But were some child of yours alive that time,&#39;,\n &#39;    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     18&#39;,\n &#34;  Shall I compare thee to a summer&#39;s day?&#34;,\n &#39;  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:&#39;,\n &#39;  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,&#39;,\n &#34;  And summer&#39;s lease hath all too short a date:&#34;,\n &#39;  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,&#39;,\n &#39;  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair from fair sometime declines,&#39;,\n &#34;  By chance, or nature&#39;s changing course untrimmed:&#34;,\n &#39;  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  Nor shall death brag thou wand&#39;rest in his shade,&#34;,\n &#34;  When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#39;    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,&#39;,\n &#39;    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     19&#39;,\n &#34;  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion&#39;s paws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#39;s jaws,&#34;,\n &#39;  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,&#39;,\n &#34;  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#39;st,&#34;,\n &#34;  And do whate&#39;er thou wilt swift-footed Time&#34;,\n &#39;  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:&#39;,\n &#39;  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,&#39;,\n &#34;  O carve not with thy hours my love&#39;s fair brow,&#34;,\n &#39;  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Him in thy course untainted do allow,&#39;,\n &#34;  For beauty&#39;s pattern to succeeding men.&#34;,\n &#39;    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,&#39;,\n &#39;    My love shall in my verse ever live young.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     20&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s face with nature&#39;s own hand painted,&#34;,\n &#39;  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,&#39;,\n &#34;  A woman&#39;s gentle heart but not acquainted&#34;,\n &#34;  With shifting change as is false women&#39;s fashion,&#34;,\n &#39;  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,&#39;,\n &#39;  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which steals men&#39;s eyes and women&#39;s souls amazeth.&#34;,\n &#39;  And for a woman wert thou first created,&#39;,\n &#39;  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by addition me of thee defeated,&#39;,\n &#39;  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.&#39;,\n &#34;    But since she pricked thee out for women&#39;s pleasure,&#34;,\n &#34;    Mine be thy love and thy love&#39;s use their treasure.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     21&#39;,\n &#39;  So is it not with me as with that muse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,&#39;,\n &#39;  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,&#39;,\n &#39;  Making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#34;  With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#39;s rich gems:&#34;,\n &#34;  With April&#39;s first-born flowers and all things rare,&#34;,\n &#34;  That heaven&#39;s air in this huge rondure hems.&#34;,\n &#39;  O let me true in love but truly write,&#39;,\n &#39;  And then believe me, my love is as fair,&#39;,\n &#34;  As any mother&#39;s child, though not so bright&#34;,\n &#34;  As those gold candles fixed in heaven&#39;s air:&#34;,\n &#39;    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,&#39;,\n &#39;    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     22&#39;,\n &#39;  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,&#39;,\n &#39;  So long as youth and thou are of one date,&#39;,\n &#34;  But when in thee time&#39;s furrows I behold,&#34;,\n &#39;  Then look I death my days should expiate.&#39;,\n &#39;  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then be elder than thou art?&#39;,\n &#39;  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,&#39;,\n &#39;  As I not for my self, but for thee will,&#39;,\n &#39;  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.&#39;,\n &#39;    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,&#39;,\n &#34;    Thou gav&#39;st me thine not to give back again.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     23&#39;,\n &#39;  As an unperfect actor on the stage,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who with his fear is put beside his part,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,&#39;,\n &#34;  Whose strength&#39;s abundance weakens his own heart;&#34;,\n &#39;  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,&#39;,\n &#34;  The perfect ceremony of love&#39;s rite,&#34;,\n &#34;  And in mine own love&#39;s strength seem to decay,&#34;,\n &#34;  O&#39;ercharged with burthen of mine own love&#39;s might:&#34;,\n &#39;  O let my looks be then the eloquence,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,&#39;,\n &#39;  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.&#39;,\n &#39;    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,&#39;,\n &#34;    To hear with eyes belongs to love&#39;s fine wit.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     24&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thy beauty&#39;s form in table of my heart,&#34;,\n &#34;  My body is the frame wherein &#39;tis held,&#34;,\n &#34;  And perspective it is best painter&#39;s art.&#34;,\n &#39;  For through the painter must you see his skill,&#39;,\n &#39;  To find where your true image pictured lies,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which in my bosom&#39;s shop is hanging still,&#34;,\n &#39;  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:&#39;,\n &#39;  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun&#39;,\n &#39;  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,&#39;,\n &#39;    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     25&#39;,\n &#39;  Let those who are in favour with their stars,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of public honour and proud titles boast,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;&#39;,\n &#34;  Great princes&#39; favourites their fair leaves spread,&#34;,\n &#34;  But as the marigold at the sun&#39;s eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in themselves their pride lies buried,&#39;,\n &#39;  For at a frown they in their glory die.&#39;,\n &#39;  The painful warrior famoused for fight,&#39;,\n &#39;  After a thousand victories once foiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is from the book of honour razed quite,&#39;,\n &#39;  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:&#39;,\n &#39;    Then happy I that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;    Where I may not remove nor be removed.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     26&#39;,\n &#39;  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;&#39;,\n &#39;  To thee I send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;  To witness duty, not to show my wit.&#39;,\n &#39;  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;&#39;,\n &#39;  But that I hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#34;  In thy soul&#39;s thought (all naked) will bestow it:&#34;,\n &#39;  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,&#39;,\n &#39;  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,&#39;,\n &#39;  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,&#39;,\n &#39;  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,&#39;,\n &#39;    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     27&#39;,\n &#39;  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,&#39;,\n &#39;  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,&#39;,\n &#39;  But then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#34;  To work my mind, when body&#39;s work&#39;s expired.&#34;,\n &#39;  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)&#39;,\n &#39;  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.&#39;,\n &#34;  Save that my soul&#39;s imaginary sight&#34;,\n &#39;  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)&#39;,\n &#39;  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.&#39;,\n &#39;    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     28&#39;,\n &#39;  How can I then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;  That am debarred the benefit of rest?&#39;,\n &#34;  When day&#39;s oppression is not eased by night,&#34;,\n &#39;  But day by night and night by day oppressed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And each (though enemies to either&#39;s reign)&#34;,\n &#39;  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one by toil, the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.&#39;,\n &#39;  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,&#39;,\n &#39;  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:&#39;,\n &#39;  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,&#39;,\n &#34;  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild&#39;st the even.&#34;,\n &#39;    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,&#39;,\n &#34;    And night doth nightly make grief&#39;s length seem stronger&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     29&#39;,\n &#34;  When in disgrace with Fortune and men&#39;s eyes,&#34;,\n &#39;  I all alone beweep my outcast state,&#39;,\n &#39;  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,&#39;,\n &#39;  And look upon my self and curse my fate,&#39;,\n &#39;  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,&#39;,\n &#39;  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,&#39;,\n &#34;  Desiring this man&#39;s art, and that man&#39;s scope,&#34;,\n &#39;  With what I most enjoy contented least,&#39;,\n &#39;  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,&#39;,\n &#39;  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,&#39;,\n &#39;  (Like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#34;  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven&#39;s gate,&#34;,\n &#39;    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,&#39;,\n &#39;    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     30&#39;,\n &#39;  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  I summon up remembrance of things past,&#39;,\n &#39;  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,&#39;,\n &#34;  And with old woes new wail my dear time&#39;s waste:&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)&#39;,\n &#34;  For precious friends hid in death&#39;s dateless night,&#34;,\n &#34;  And weep afresh love&#39;s long since cancelled woe,&#34;,\n &#34;  And moan th&#39; expense of many a vanished sight.&#34;,\n &#39;  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,&#39;,\n &#34;  And heavily from woe to woe tell o&#39;er&#34;,\n &#39;  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I new pay as if not paid before.&#39;,\n &#39;    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)&#39;,\n &#39;    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     31&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,&#39;,\n &#34;  And there reigns love and all love&#39;s loving parts,&#34;,\n &#39;  And all those friends which I thought buried.&#39;,\n &#39;  How many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#34;  Hath dear religious love stol&#39;n from mine eye,&#34;,\n &#39;  As interest of the dead, which now appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That due of many, now is thine alone.&#39;,\n &#39;    Their images I loved, I view in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     32&#39;,\n &#39;  If thou survive my well-contented day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey&#39;,\n &#39;  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:&#39;,\n &#34;  Compare them with the bett&#39;ring of the time,&#34;,\n &#39;  And though they be outstripped by every pen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  Exceeded by the height of happier men.&#39;,\n &#39;  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Had my friend&#39;s Muse grown with this growing age,&#34;,\n &#39;  A dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;  To march in ranks of better equipage:&#39;,\n &#39;    But since he died and poets better prove,&#39;,\n &#34;    Theirs for their style I&#39;ll read, his for his love&#39;.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     33&#39;,\n &#39;  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,&#39;,\n &#39;  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;&#39;,\n &#39;  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:&#39;,\n &#39;  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,&#39;,\n &#39;  With ugly rack on his celestial face,&#39;,\n &#39;  And from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,&#39;,\n &#39;  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,&#39;,\n &#39;  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,&#39;,\n &#39;  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.&#39;,\n &#39;    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,&#39;,\n &#34;    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven&#39;s sun staineth.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     34&#39;,\n &#39;  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,&#39;,\n &#39;  And make me travel forth without my cloak,&#39;,\n &#34;  To let base clouds o&#39;ertake me in my way,&#34;,\n &#34;  Hiding thy brav&#39;ry in their rotten smoke?&#34;,\n &#34;  &#39;Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,&#34;,\n &#39;  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,&#39;,\n &#39;  For no man well of such a salve can speak,&#39;,\n &#39;  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; offender&#39;s sorrow lends but weak relief&#34;,\n &#34;  To him that bears the strong offence&#39;s cross.&#34;,\n &#39;    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,&#39;,\n &#39;    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     35&#39;,\n &#39;  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,&#39;,\n &#39;  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,&#39;,\n &#39;  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,&#39;,\n &#39;  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.&#39;,\n &#39;  All men make faults, and even I in this,&#39;,\n &#39;  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,&#39;,\n &#39;  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:&#39;,\n &#39;  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,&#39;,\n &#34;  And &#39;gainst my self a lawful plea commence:&#34;,\n &#39;  Such civil war is in my love and hate,&#39;,\n &#39;    That I an accessary needs must be,&#39;,\n &#39;    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     36&#39;,\n &#39;  Let me confess that we two must be twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Although our undivided loves are one:&#39;,\n &#39;  So shall those blots that do with me remain,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.&#39;,\n &#39;  In our two loves there is but one respect,&#39;,\n &#39;  Though in our lives a separable spite,&#39;,\n &#34;  Which though it alter not love&#39;s sole effect,&#34;,\n &#34;  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:&#39;,\n &#39;    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,&#39;,\n &#39;    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     37&#39;,\n &#39;  As a decrepit father takes delight,&#39;,\n &#39;  To see his active child do deeds of youth,&#39;,\n &#34;  So I, made lame by Fortune&#39;s dearest spite&#34;,\n &#39;  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.&#39;,\n &#39;  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or any of these all, or all, or more&#39;,\n &#39;  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,&#39;,\n &#39;  I make my love engrafted to this store:&#39;,\n &#39;  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,&#39;,\n &#39;  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by a part of all thy glory live:&#39;,\n &#39;    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     38&#39;,\n &#39;  How can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#34;  While thou dost breathe that pour&#39;st into my verse,&#34;,\n &#39;  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,&#39;,\n &#39;  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?&#39;,\n &#39;  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  For who&#39;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,&#34;,\n &#39;  When thou thy self dost give invention light?&#39;,\n &#39;  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,&#39;,\n &#39;  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.&#39;,\n &#39;    If my slight muse do please these curious days,&#39;,\n &#39;    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     39&#39;,\n &#39;  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,&#39;,\n &#39;  When thou art all the better part of me?&#39;,\n &#39;  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:&#39;,\n &#34;  And what is&#39;t but mine own when I praise thee?&#34;,\n &#39;  Even for this, let us divided live,&#39;,\n &#39;  And our dear love lose name of single one,&#39;,\n &#39;  That by this separation I may give:&#39;,\n &#34;  That due to thee which thou deserv&#39;st alone:&#34;,\n &#39;  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,&#39;,\n &#39;  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,&#39;,\n &#39;  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.&#39;,\n &#39;    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,&#39;,\n &#39;    By praising him here who doth hence remain.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     40&#39;,\n &#39;  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,&#39;,\n &#39;  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?&#39;,\n &#39;  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,&#39;,\n &#39;  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:&#39;,\n &#39;  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,&#39;,\n &#39;  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,&#39;,\n &#39;  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.&#39;,\n &#39;  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#34;  To bear greater wrong, than hate&#39;s known injury.&#34;,\n &#39;    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,&#39;,\n &#39;    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     41&#39;,\n &#39;  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,&#39;,\n &#39;  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,&#39;,\n &#39;  For still temptation follows where thou art.&#39;,\n &#39;  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,&#39;,\n &#39;  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.&#39;,\n &#34;  And when a woman woos, what woman&#39;s son,&#34;,\n &#39;  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?&#39;,\n &#39;  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:&#39;,\n &#39;    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     42&#39;,\n &#39;  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,&#39;,\n &#39;  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,&#39;,\n &#39;  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.&#39;,\n &#39;  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,&#39;,\n &#34;  Thou dost love her, because thou know&#39;st I love her,&#34;,\n &#39;  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,&#39;,\n &#34;  Suff&#39;ring my friend for my sake to approve her.&#34;,\n &#34;  If I lose thee, my loss is my love&#39;s gain,&#34;,\n &#39;  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,&#39;,\n &#39;  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,&#39;,\n &#39;  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,&#39;,\n &#34;    But here&#39;s the joy, my friend and I are one,&#34;,\n &#39;    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     43&#39;,\n &#39;  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,&#39;,\n &#39;  For all the day they view things unrespected,&#39;,\n &#39;  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.&#39;,\n &#39;  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#34;  How would thy shadow&#39;s form, form happy show,&#34;,\n &#39;  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,&#39;,\n &#39;  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!&#39;,\n &#39;  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,&#39;,\n &#39;  By looking on thee in the living day,&#39;,\n &#39;  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!&#39;,\n &#39;    All days are nights to see till I see thee,&#39;,\n &#39;    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     44&#39;,\n &#39;  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Injurious distance should not stop my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  For then despite of space I would be brought,&#39;,\n &#39;  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,&#39;,\n &#39;  No matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,&#39;,\n &#39;  As soon as think the place where he would be.&#39;,\n &#39;  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,&#39;,\n &#39;  But that so much of earth and water wrought,&#39;,\n &#34;  I must attend, time&#39;s leisure with my moan.&#34;,\n &#39;    Receiving nought by elements so slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    But heavy tears, badges of either&#39;s woe.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     45&#39;,\n &#39;  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,&#39;,\n &#39;  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,&#39;,\n &#39;  The first my thought, the other my desire,&#39;,\n &#39;  These present-absent with swift motion slide.&#39;,\n &#39;  For when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;  In tender embassy of love to thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  My life being made of four, with two alone,&#39;,\n &#39;  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.&#39;,\n &#34;  Until life&#39;s composition be recured,&#34;,\n &#39;  By those swift messengers returned from thee,&#39;,\n &#39;  Who even but now come back again assured,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.&#39;,\n &#39;    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,&#39;,\n &#39;    I send them back again and straight grow sad.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     46&#39;,\n &#39;  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,&#39;,\n &#39;  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,&#39;,\n &#34;  Mine eye, my heart thy picture&#39;s sight would bar,&#34;,\n &#39;  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,&#39;,\n &#39;  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,&#39;,\n &#39;  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)&#39;,\n &#39;  But the defendant doth that plea deny,&#39;,\n &#39;  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.&#39;,\n &#39;  To side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,&#39;,\n &#39;  And by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#34;  The clear eye&#39;s moiety, and the dear heart&#39;s part.&#34;,\n &#34;    As thus, mine eye&#39;s due is thy outward part,&#34;,\n &#34;    And my heart&#39;s right, thy inward love of heart.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     47&#39;,\n &#39;  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,&#39;,\n &#39;  And each doth good turns now unto the other,&#39;,\n &#39;  When that mine eye is famished for a look,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;&#39;,\n &#34;  With my love&#39;s picture then my eye doth feast,&#34;,\n &#39;  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:&#39;,\n &#34;  Another time mine eye is my heart&#39;s guest,&#34;,\n &#39;  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.&#39;,\n &#39;  So either by thy picture or my love,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy self away, art present still with me,&#39;,\n &#39;  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,&#39;,\n &#39;  And I am still with them, and they with thee.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#34;    Awakes my heart, to heart&#39;s and eye&#39;s delight.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     48&#39;,\n &#39;  How careful was I when I took my way,&#39;,\n &#39;  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,&#39;,\n &#39;  That to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!&#39;,\n &#39;  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,&#39;,\n &#39;  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,&#39;,\n &#39;  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.&#39;,\n &#39;  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the gentle closure of my breast,&#39;,\n &#39;  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,&#39;,\n &#34;    And even thence thou wilt be stol&#39;n I fear,&#34;,\n &#39;    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     49&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time (if ever that time come)&#39;,\n &#39;  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,&#39;,\n &#39;  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,&#39;,\n &#39;  Called to that audit by advised respects,&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,&#39;,\n &#39;  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,&#39;,\n &#39;  When love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;&#39;,\n &#39;  Against that time do I ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,&#39;,\n &#39;  And this my hand, against my self uprear,&#39;,\n &#39;  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,&#39;,\n &#39;    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,&#39;,\n &#39;    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     50&#39;,\n &#39;  How heavy do I journey on the way,&#39;,\n &#34;  When what I seek (my weary travel&#39;s end)&#34;,\n &#39;  Doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.&#39;&#34;,\n &#39;  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,&#39;,\n &#39;  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,&#39;,\n &#39;  As if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:&#39;,\n &#39;  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,&#39;,\n &#39;  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which heavily he answers with a groan,&#39;,\n &#39;  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,&#39;,\n &#39;    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,&#39;,\n &#39;    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     51&#39;,\n &#39;  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,&#39;,\n &#39;  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?&#39;,\n &#39;  Till I return of posting is no need.&#39;,\n &#39;  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,&#39;,\n &#39;  When swift extremity can seem but slow?&#39;,\n &#39;  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,&#39;,\n &#39;  In winged speed no motion shall I know,&#39;,\n &#39;  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,&#39;,\n &#34;  Therefore desire (of perfect&#39;st love being made)&#34;,\n &#39;  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,&#39;,\n &#39;  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,&#39;,\n &#39;    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,&#39;,\n &#34;    Towards thee I&#39;ll run, and give him leave to go.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     52&#39;,\n &#39;  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,&#39;,\n &#39;  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,&#39;,\n &#39;  The which he will not every hour survey,&#39;,\n &#39;  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.&#39;,\n &#39;  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,&#39;,\n &#39;  Since seldom coming in that long year set,&#39;,\n &#39;  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,&#39;,\n &#39;  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.&#39;,\n &#39;  So is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,&#39;,\n &#39;  To make some special instant special-blest,&#39;,\n &#39;  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.&#39;,\n &#39;    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,&#39;,\n &#39;    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     53&#39;,\n &#39;  What is your substance, whereof are you made,&#39;,\n &#39;  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?&#39;,\n &#39;  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,&#39;,\n &#39;  And you but one, can every shadow lend:&#39;,\n &#39;  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,&#39;,\n &#39;  Is poorly imitated after you,&#39;,\n &#34;  On Helen&#39;s cheek all art of beauty set,&#34;,\n &#39;  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:&#39;,\n &#39;  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,&#39;,\n &#39;  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,&#39;,\n &#39;  The other as your bounty doth appear,&#39;,\n &#39;  And you in every blessed shape we know.&#39;,\n &#39;    In all external grace you have some part,&#39;,\n &#39;    But you like none, none you for constant heart.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     54&#39;,\n &#39;  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,&#39;,\n &#39;  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!&#39;,\n &#39;  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:&#39;,\n &#39;  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,&#39;,\n &#39;  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,&#39;,\n &#34;  When summer&#39;s breath their masked buds discloses:&#34;,\n &#39;  But for their virtue only is their show,&#39;,\n &#39;  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,&#39;,\n &#39;  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,&#39;,\n &#39;  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:&#39;,\n &#39;    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,&#39;,\n &#39;    When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     55&#39;,\n &#39;  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,&#39;,\n &#39;  But you shall shine more bright in these contents&#39;,\n &#39;  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.&#39;,\n &#39;  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,&#39;,\n &#39;  And broils root out the work of masonry,&#39;,\n &#34;  Nor Mars his sword, nor war&#39;s quick fire shall burn:&#34;,\n &#39;  The living record of your memory.&#39;,\n &#34;  &#39;Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity&#34;,\n &#39;  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,&#39;,\n &#39;  Even in the eyes of all posterity&#39;,\n &#39;  That wear this world out to the ending doom.&#39;,\n &#39;    So till the judgment that your self arise,&#39;,\n &#34;    You live in this, and dwell in lovers&#39; eyes.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     56&#39;,\n &#39;  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,&#39;,\n &#39;  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.&#39;,\n &#39;  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill&#39;,\n &#39;  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,&#39;,\n &#39;  To-morrow see again, and do not kill&#39;,\n &#39;  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:&#39;,\n &#39;  Let this sad interim like the ocean be&#39;,\n &#39;  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,&#39;,\n &#39;  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:&#39;,\n &#39;  Return of love, more blest may be the view.&#39;,\n &#39;    Or call it winter, which being full of care,&#39;,\n &#34;    Makes summer&#39;s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     57&#39;,\n &#39;  Being your slave what should I do but tend,&#39;,\n &#39;  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?&#39;,\n &#39;  I have no precious time at all to spend;&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor services to do till you require.&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,&#39;,\n &#39;  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,&#39;,\n &#39;  When you have bid your servant once adieu.&#39;,\n &#39;  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,&#39;,\n &#39;  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,&#39;,\n &#39;  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought&#39;,\n &#39;  Save where you are, how happy you make those.&#39;,\n &#39;    So true a fool is love, that in your will,&#39;,\n &#39;    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     58&#39;,\n &#39;  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,&#39;,\n &#39;  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,&#39;,\n &#34;  Or at your hand th&#39; account of hours to crave,&#34;,\n &#39;  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.&#39;,\n &#39;  O let me suffer (being at your beck)&#39;,\n &#34;  Th&#39; imprisoned absence of your liberty,&#34;,\n &#39;  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,&#39;,\n &#39;  Without accusing you of injury.&#39;,\n &#39;  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,&#39;,\n &#39;  That you your self may privilage your time&#39;,\n &#39;  To what you will, to you it doth belong,&#39;,\n &#39;  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.&#39;,\n &#39;    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,&#39;,\n &#39;    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;                     59&#39;,\n &#39;  If there be nothing new, but that which is,&#39;,\n &#39;  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,&#39;,\n &#39;  Which labouring for invention bear amis&#39;,\n &#39;  The second burthen of a former child!&#39;,\n &#39;  O that record could with a backward look,&#39;,\n ...]</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2.

prepare&#39;,\n &#39;and your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39;so should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#39;your self again after your selfs decease&#39;,\n &#39;when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39;who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39;which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#39;against the stormy gusts of winters day&#39;,\n &#39;and barren rage of deaths eternal cold&#39;,\n &#39;o none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39;you had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;14&#39;,\n &#39;not from the stars do i my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39;and yet methinks i have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39;but not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#39;of plagues of dearths or seasons quality&#39;,\n &#39;nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39;pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39;or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;by oft predict that i in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39;but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive&#39;,\n &#39;and constant stars in them i read such art&#39;,\n &#39;as truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39;or else of thee this i prognosticate&#39;,\n &#39;thy end is truths and beautys doom and date&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;15&#39;,\n &#39;when i consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39;that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39;when i perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39;cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky&#39;,\n &#39;vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39;and wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39;then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39;sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39;where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;to change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39;and all in war with time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39;as he takes from you i engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;16&#39;,\n &#39;but wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;make war upon this bloody tyrant time&#39;,\n &#39;and fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;with means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39;and many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39;with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39;much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;so should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#39;which this times pencil or my pupil pen&#39;,\n &#39;neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39;to give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39;and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;17&#39;,\n &#39;who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;if it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39;though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39;if i could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39;and in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39;the age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#39;such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces&#39;,\n &#39;so should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39;be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#39;and your true rights be termed a poets rage&#39;,\n &#39;and stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39;but were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39;you should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;18&#39;,\n &#39;shall i compare thee to a summers day&#39;,\n &#39;thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39;rough winds do shake the darling buds of may&#39;,\n &#39;and summers lease hath all too short a date&#39;,\n &#39;sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39;and often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#39;by chance or natures changing course untrimmed&#39;,\n &#39;but thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#39;nor lose possession of that fair thou owst&#39;,\n &#39;nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade&#39;,\n &#39;when in eternal lines to time thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;so long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39;so long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;19&#39;,\n &#39;devouring time blunt thou the lions paws&#39;,\n &#39;and make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#39;pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws&#39;,\n &#39;and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#39;make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst&#39;,\n &#39;and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time&#39;,\n &#39;to the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39;but i forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#39;o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow&#39;,\n &#39;nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39;him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#39;for beautys pattern to succeeding men&#39;,\n &#39;yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39;my love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;20&#39;,\n &#39;a womans face with natures own hand painted&#39;,\n &#39;hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#39;a womans gentle heart but not acquainted&#39;,\n &#39;with shifting change as is false womens fashion&#39;,\n &#39;an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39;gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39;a man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#39;which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth&#39;,\n &#39;and for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39;till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting&#39;,\n &#39;and by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39;by adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#39;but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;21&#39;,\n &#39;so is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39;stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39;who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#39;with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems&#39;,\n &#39;with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare&#39;,\n &#39;that heavens air in this huge rondure hems&#39;,\n &#39;o let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39;and then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#39;as any mothers child though not so bright&#39;,\n &#39;as those gold candles fixed in heavens air&#39;,\n &#39;let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39;i will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;22&#39;,\n &#39;my glass shall not persuade me i am old&#39;,\n &#39;so long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#39;but when in thee times furrows i behold&#39;,\n &#39;then look i death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39;for all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39;is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;o therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39;as i not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39;bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;as tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39;presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#39;thou gavst me thine not to give back again&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;23&#39;,\n &#39;as an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39;who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39;or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#39;whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart&#39;,\n &#39;so i for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#39;the perfect ceremony of loves rite&#39;,\n &#39;and in mine own loves strength seem to decay&#39;,\n &#39;oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might&#39;,\n &#39;o let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39;and dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39;who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39;more than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39;o learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#39;to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;24&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#39;thy beautys form in table of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;my body is the frame wherein tis held&#39;,\n &#39;and perspective it is best painters art&#39;,\n &#39;for through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39;to find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#39;which in my bosoms shop is hanging still&#39;,\n &#39;that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39;now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39;mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun&#39;,\n &#39;delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39;yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39;they draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;25&#39;,\n &#39;let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39;of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked for joy in that i honour most&#39;,\n &#39;great princes favourites their fair leaves spread&#39;,\n &#39;but as the marigold at the suns eye&#39;,\n &#39;and in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39;for at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39;the painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39;after a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39;is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39;and all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39;then happy i that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;where i may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;26&#39;,\n &#39;lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39;to thee i send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;to witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39;duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;may make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39;but that i hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#39;in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it&#39;,\n &#39;till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39;points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39;and puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39;to show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39;then may i dare to boast how i do love thee&#39;,\n &#39;till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;27&#39;,\n &#39;weary with toil i haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39;the dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39;but then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#39;to work my mind when bodys works expired&#39;,\n &#39;for then my thoughts from far where i abide&#39;,\n &#39;intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39;and keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39;looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#39;save that my souls imaginary sight&#39;,\n &#39;presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39;which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39;makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39;lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39;for thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;28&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;that am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#39;when days oppression is not eased by night&#39;,\n &#39;but day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#39;and each though enemies to eithers reign&#39;,\n &#39;do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39;the one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;how far i toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39;i tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39;and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39;so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night&#39;,\n &#39;when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even&#39;,\n &#39;but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#39;and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;29&#39;,\n &#39;when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes&#39;,\n &#39;i all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39;and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39;and look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39;wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39;featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#39;desiring this mans art and that mans scope&#39;,\n &#39;with what i most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39;yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39;haply i think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39;like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#39;from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate&#39;,\n &#39;for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39;that then i scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;30&#39;,\n &#39;when to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39;i summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39;i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought&#39;,\n &#39;and with old woes new wail my dear times waste&#39;,\n &#39;then can i drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#39;for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night&#39;,\n &#39;and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe&#39;,\n &#39;and moan th expense of many a vanished sight&#39;,\n &#39;then can i grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#39;and heavily from woe to woe tell oer&#39;,\n &#39;the sad account of forebemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39;which i new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39;but if the while i think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39;all losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;31&#39;,\n &#39;thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39;which i by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#39;and there reigns love and all loves loving parts&#39;,\n &#39;and all those friends which i thought buried&#39;,\n &#39;how many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#39;hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye&#39;,\n &#39;as interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39;but things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39;thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39;hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39;who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39;that due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39;their images i loved i view in thee&#39;,\n &#39;and thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;32&#39;,\n &#39;if thou survive my wellcontented day&#39;,\n &#39;when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;and shalt by fortune once more resurvey&#39;,\n &#39;these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#39;compare them with the bettring of the time&#39;,\n &#39;and though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39;reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39;o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#39;had my friends muse grown with this growing age&#39;,\n &#39;a dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;to march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39;but since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#39;theirs for their style ill read his for his love&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;33&#39;,\n &#39;full many a glorious morning have i seen&#39;,\n &#39;flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39;kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39;gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39;anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39;with ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39;and from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39;with all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39;but out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39;the region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39;yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#39;suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;34&#39;,\n &#39;why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39;and make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#39;to let base clouds oertake me in my way&#39;,\n &#39;hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke&#39;,\n &#39;tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#39;,\n &#39;to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face&#39;,\n &#39;for no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39;that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39;though thou repent yet i have still the loss&#39;,\n &#39;th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief&#39;,\n &#39;to him that bears the strong offences cross&#39;,\n &#39;ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39;and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;35&#39;,\n &#39;no more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39;roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39;clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39;and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39;all men make faults and even i in this&#39;,\n &#39;authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39;my self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39;excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39;for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39;thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#39;and gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#39;,\n &#39;such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39;that i an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39;to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;36&#39;,\n &#39;let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39;although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39;so shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39;without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39;in our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39;though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#39;which though it alter not loves sole effect&#39;,\n &#39;yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight&#39;,\n &#39;i may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39;lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39;nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39;unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39;but do not so i love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39;as thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;37&#39;,\n &#39;as a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39;to see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#39;so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite&#39;,\n &#39;take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39;for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39;or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39;entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39;i make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39;so then i am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39;whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39;that i in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39;and by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39;look what is best that best i wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39;this wish i have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;38&#39;,\n &#39;how can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#39;while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse&#39;,\n &#39;thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39;for every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;o give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39;worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee&#39;,\n &#39;when thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39;be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39;and he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39;if my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39;the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;39&#39;,\n &#39;o how thy worth with manners may i sing&#39;,\n &#39;when thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39;what can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#39;and what ist but mine own when i praise thee&#39;,\n &#39;even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39;and our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39;that by this separation i may give&#39;,\n &#39;that due to thee which thou deservst alone&#39;,\n &#39;o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39;were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39;to entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39;which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39;and that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39;by praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;40&#39;,\n &#39;take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39;what hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39;no love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39;all mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39;then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39;i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39;but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;by wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39;i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39;and yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#39;to bear greater wrong than hates known injury&#39;,\n &#39;lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39;kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;41&#39;,\n &#39;those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39;when i am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39;thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39;for still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39;gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39;beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#39;and when a woman woos what womans son&#39;,\n &#39;will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39;ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39;and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39;who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39;hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39;thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;42&#39;,\n &#39;that thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39;and yet it may be said i loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39;that she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39;a loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39;loving offenders thus i will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#39;thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her&#39;,\n &#39;and for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#39;suffring my friend for my sake to approve her&#39;,\n &#39;if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain&#39;,\n &#39;and losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39;both find each other and i lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39;and both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#39;but heres the joy my friend and i are one&#39;,\n &#39;sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;43&#39;,\n &#39;when most i wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39;for all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39;but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39;and darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39;then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#39;how would thy shadows form form happy show&#39;,\n &#39;to the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39;when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39;how would i say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39;by looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39;when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39;through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39;all days are nights to see till i see thee&#39;,\n &#39;and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;44&#39;,\n &#39;if the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39;injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39;for then despite of space i would be brought&#39;,\n &#39;from limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39;no matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39;for nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39;as soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39;but ah thought kills me that i am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39;but that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#39;i must attend times leisure with my moan&#39;,\n &#39;receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#39;but heavy tears badges of eithers woe&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;45&#39;,\n &#39;the other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39;are both with thee wherever i abide&#39;,\n &#39;the first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39;these presentabsent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39;for when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;in tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39;my life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39;sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#39;until lifes composition be recured&#39;,\n &#39;by those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39;who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39;of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39;this told i joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39;i send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;46&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39;how to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar&#39;,\n &#39;my heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39;my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39;a closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39;but the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39;and says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39;to side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39;and by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#39;the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part&#39;,\n &#39;as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part&#39;,\n &#39;and my hearts right thy inward love of heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;47&#39;,\n &#39;betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39;and each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39;when that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39;or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#39;with my loves picture then my eye doth feast&#39;,\n &#39;and to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#39;another time mine eye is my hearts guest&#39;,\n &#39;and in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39;so either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39;thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39;for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39;and i am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39;or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#39;awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;48&#39;,\n &#39;how careful was i when i took my way&#39;,\n &#39;each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39;that to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39;but thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39;most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39;thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39;art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39;thee have i not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39;save where thou art not though i feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39;within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39;from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#39;and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear&#39;,\n &#39;for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;49&#39;,\n &#39;against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39;when i shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39;when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum&#39;,\n &#39;called to that audit by advised respects&#39;,\n &#39;against that time when thou shalt strangely pass&#39;,\n &#39;and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye&#39;,\n &#39;when love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;shall reasons find of settled gravity&#39;,\n &#39;against that time do i ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;within the knowledge of mine own desert&#39;,\n &#39;and this my hand against my self uprear&#39;,\n &#39;to guard the lawful reasons on thy part&#39;,\n &#39;to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws&#39;,\n &#39;since why to love i can allege no cause&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;50&#39;,\n &#39;how heavy do i journey on the way&#39;,\n &#39;when what i seek my weary travels end&#39;,\n &#39;doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#39;thus far the miles are measured from thy friend&#39;,\n &#39;the beast that bears me tired with my woe&#39;,\n &#39;plods dully on to bear that weight in me&#39;,\n &#39;as if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;his rider loved not speed being made from thee&#39;,\n &#39;the bloody spur cannot provoke him on&#39;,\n &#39;that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide&#39;,\n &#39;which heavily he answers with a groan&#39;,\n &#39;more sharp to me than spurring to his side&#39;,\n &#39;for that same groan doth put this in my mind&#39;,\n &#39;my grief lies onward and my joy behind&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;51&#39;,\n &#39;thus can my love excuse the slow offence&#39;,\n &#39;of my dull bearer when from thee i speed&#39;,\n &#39;from where thou art why should i haste me thence&#39;,\n &#39;till i return of posting is no need&#39;,\n &#39;o what excuse will my poor beast then find&#39;,\n &#39;when swift extremity can seem but slow&#39;,\n &#39;then should i spur though mounted on the wind&#39;,\n &#39;in winged speed no motion shall i know&#39;,\n &#39;then can no horse with my desire keep pace&#39;,\n &#39;therefore desire of perfectst love being made&#39;,\n &#39;shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race&#39;,\n &#39;but love for love thus shall excuse my jade&#39;,\n &#39;since from thee going he went wilfulslow&#39;,\n &#39;towards thee ill run and give him leave to go&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;52&#39;,\n &#39;so am i as the rich whose blessed key&#39;,\n &#39;can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure&#39;,\n &#39;the which he will not every hour survey&#39;,\n &#39;for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare&#39;,\n &#39;since seldom coming in that long year set&#39;,\n &#39;like stones of worth they thinly placed are&#39;,\n &#39;or captain jewels in the carcanet&#39;,\n &#39;so is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide&#39;,\n &#39;to make some special instant specialblest&#39;,\n &#39;by new unfolding his imprisoned pride&#39;,\n &#39;blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope&#39;,\n &#39;being had to triumph being lacked to hope&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;53&#39;,\n &#39;what is your substance whereof are you made&#39;,\n &#39;that millions of strange shadows on you tend&#39;,\n &#39;since every one hath every one one shade&#39;,\n &#39;and you but one can every shadow lend&#39;,\n &#39;describe adonis and the counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;is poorly imitated after you&#39;,\n &#39;on helens cheek all art of beauty set&#39;,\n &#39;and you in grecian tires are painted new&#39;,\n &#39;speak of the spring and foison of the year&#39;,\n &#39;the one doth shadow of your beauty show&#39;,\n &#39;the other as your bounty doth appear&#39;,\n &#39;and you in every blessed shape we know&#39;,\n &#39;in all external grace you have some part&#39;,\n &#39;but you like none none you for constant heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;54&#39;,\n &#39;o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem&#39;,\n &#39;by that sweet ornament which truth doth give&#39;,\n &#39;the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;for that sweet odour which doth in it live&#39;,\n &#39;the canker blooms have full as deep a dye&#39;,\n &#39;as the perfumed tincture of the roses&#39;,\n &#39;hang on such thorns and play as wantonly&#39;,\n &#39;when summers breath their masked buds discloses&#39;,\n &#39;but for their virtue only is their show&#39;,\n &#39;they live unwooed and unrespected fade&#39;,\n &#39;die to themselves sweet roses do not so&#39;,\n &#39;of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made&#39;,\n &#39;and so of you beauteous and lovely youth&#39;,\n &#39;when that shall fade my verse distills your truth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;55&#39;,\n &#39;not marble nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;but you shall shine more bright in these contents&#39;,\n &#39;than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time&#39;,\n &#39;when wasteful war shall statues overturn&#39;,\n &#39;and broils root out the work of masonry&#39;,\n &#39;nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn&#39;,\n &#39;the living record of your memory&#39;,\n &#39;gainst death and alloblivious enmity&#39;,\n &#39;shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room&#39;,\n &#39;even in the eyes of all posterity&#39;,\n &#39;that wear this world out to the ending doom&#39;,\n &#39;so till the judgment that your self arise&#39;,\n &#39;you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;56&#39;,\n &#39;sweet love renew thy force be it not said&#39;,\n &#39;thy edge should blunter be than appetite&#39;,\n &#39;which but today by feeding is allayed&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow sharpened in his former might&#39;,\n &#39;so love be thou although today thou fill&#39;,\n &#39;thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow see again and do not kill&#39;,\n &#39;the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness&#39;,\n &#39;let this sad interim like the ocean be&#39;,\n &#39;which parts the shore where two contracted new&#39;,\n &#39;come daily to the banks that when they see&#39;,\n &#39;return of love more blest may be the view&#39;,\n &#39;or call it winter which being full of care&#39;,\n &#39;makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n

think of nought&#39;,\n &#39;save where you are how happy you make those&#39;,\n &#39;so true a fool is love that in your will&#39;,\n &#39;though you do any thing he thinks no ill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;58&#39;,\n &#39;that god forbid that made me first your slave&#39;,\n &#39;i should in thought control your times of pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;or at your hand th account

his golden pilgrimage&#39;,\n &#39;but when from highmost pitch with weary car&#39;,\n &#39;like feeble age he reeleth from the day&#39;,\n &#39;the eyes fore duteous now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;from his low tract and look another way&#39;,\n &#39;so thou thy self outgoing in thy noon&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked on diest unless thou get a son&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;8&#39;,\n &#39;music to hear why hearst thou music sadly&#39;,\n &#39;sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy&#39;,\n &#39;why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly&#39;,\n &#39;or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy&#39;,\n &#39;if the true concord of welltuned sounds&#39;,\n &#39;by unions married do offend thine ear&#39;,\n &#39;they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39;mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39;strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39;resembling sire and child and happy mother&#39;,\n &#39;who all in one one pleasing note do sing&#39;,\n &#39;whose speechless song being many seeming one&#39;,\n &#39;sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;9&#39;,\n &#39;is it for fear to wet a widows eye&#39;,\n &#39;that thou consumst thy self in single life&#39;,\n &#39;ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die&#39;,\n &#39;the world will wail thee like a makeless wife&#39;,\n &#39;the world will be thy widow and still weep&#39;,\n &#39;that thou no form of thee hast left behind&#39;,\n &#39;when every private widow well may keep&#39;,\n &#39;by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind&#39;,\n &#39;look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it&#39;,\n &#39;but beautys waste hath in the world an end&#39;,\n &#39;and kept unused the user so destroys it&#39;,\n &#39;no love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#39;that on himself such murdrous shame commits&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;10&#39;,\n &#39;for shame deny that thou bearst love to any&#39;,\n &#39;who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39;grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#39;but that thou none lovst is most evident&#39;,\n &#39;for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate&#39;,\n &#39;that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire&#39;,\n &#39;seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39;o change thy thought that i may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39;shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39;be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39;or to thy self at least kindhearted prove&#39;,\n &#39;make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39;that beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;11&#39;,\n &#39;as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;in one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#39;and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst&#39;,\n &#39;thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39;herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39;without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39;if all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39;and threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39;let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39;harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39;look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39;which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39;she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39;thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;12&#39;,\n &#39;when i do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39;and see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39;when i behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#39;and sable curls all silvered oer with white&#39;,\n &#39;when lofty trees i see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39;which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#39;and summers green all girded up in sheaves&#39;,\n &#39;borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39;then of thy beauty do i question make&#39;,\n &#39;that thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39;since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39;and die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#39;and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence&#39;,\n &#39;save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;13&#39;,\n &#39;o that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;no longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39;against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39;and your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39;so should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#39;your self again after your selfs decease&#39;,\n &#39;when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39;who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39;which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#39;against the stormy gusts of winters day&#39;,\n &#39;and barren rage of deaths eternal cold&#39;,\n &#39;o none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39;you had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;14&#39;,\n &#39;not from the stars do i my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39;and yet methinks i have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39;but not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#39;of plagues of dearths or seasons quality&#39;,\n &#39;nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39;pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39;or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;by oft predict that i in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39;but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive&#39;,\n &#39;and constant stars in them i read such art&#39;,\n &#39;as truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39;or else of thee this i prognosticate&#39;,\n &#39;thy end is truths and beautys doom and date&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;15&#39;,\n &#39;when i consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39;that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39;when i perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39;cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky&#39;,\n &#39;vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39;and wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39;then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39;sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39;where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;to change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39;and all in war with time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39;as he takes from you i engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;16&#39;,\n &#39;but wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;make war upon this bloody tyrant time&#39;,\n &#39;and fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;with means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39;and many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39;with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39;much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;so should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#39;which this times pencil or my pupil pen&#39;,\n &#39;neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39;to give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39;and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;17&#39;,\n &#39;who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;if it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39;though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39;if i could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39;and in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39;the age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#39;such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces&#39;,\n &#39;so should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39;be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#39;and your true rights be termed a poets rage&#39;,\n &#39;and stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39;but were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39;you should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;18&#39;,\n &#39;shall i compare thee to a summers day&#39;,\n &#39;thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39;rough winds do shake the darling buds of may&#39;,\n &#39;and summers lease hath all too short a date&#39;,\n &#39;sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39;and often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#39;by chance or natures changing course untrimmed&#39;,\n &#39;but thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#39;nor lose possession of that fair thou owst&#39;,\n &#39;nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade&#39;,\n &#39;when in eternal lines to time thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;so long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39;so long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;19&#39;,\n &#39;devouring time blunt thou the lions paws&#39;,\n &#39;and make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#39;pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws&#39;,\n &#39;and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#39;make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst&#39;,\n &#39;and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time&#39;,\n &#39;to the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39;but i forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#39;o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow&#39;,\n &#39;nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39;him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#39;for beautys pattern to succeeding men&#39;,\n &#39;yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39;my love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;20&#39;,\n &#39;a womans face with natures own hand painted&#39;,\n &#39;hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#39;a womans gentle heart but not acquainted&#39;,\n &#39;with shifting change as is false womens fashion&#39;,\n &#39;an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39;gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39;a man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#39;which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth&#39;,\n &#39;and for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39;till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting&#39;,\n &#39;and by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39;by adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#39;but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;21&#39;,\n &#39;so is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39;stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39;who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#39;with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems&#39;,\n &#39;with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare&#39;,\n &#39;that heavens air in this huge rondure hems&#39;,\n &#39;o let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39;and then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#39;as any mothers child though not so bright&#39;,\n &#39;as those gold candles fixed in heavens air&#39;,\n &#39;let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39;i will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;22&#39;,\n &#39;my glass shall not persuade me i am old&#39;,\n &#39;so long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#39;but when in thee times furrows i behold&#39;,\n &#39;then look i death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39;for all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39;is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;o therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39;as i not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39;bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;as tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39;presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#39;thou gavst me thine not to give back again&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;23&#39;,\n &#39;as an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39;who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39;or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#39;whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart&#39;,\n &#39;so i for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#39;the perfect ceremony of loves rite&#39;,\n &#39;and in mine own loves strength seem to decay&#39;,\n &#39;oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might&#39;,\n &#39;o let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39;and dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39;who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39;more than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39;o learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#39;to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;24&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#39;thy beautys form in table of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;my body is the frame wherein tis held&#39;,\n &#39;and perspective it is best painters art&#39;,\n &#39;for through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39;to find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#39;which in my bosoms shop is hanging still&#39;,\n &#39;that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39;now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39;mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun&#39;,\n &#39;delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39;yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39;they draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;25&#39;,\n &#39;let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39;of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked for joy in that i honour most&#39;,\n &#39;great princes favourites their fair leaves spread&#39;,\n &#39;but as the marigold at the suns eye&#39;,\n &#39;and in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39;for at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39;the painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39;after a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39;is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39;and all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39;then happy i that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;where i may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;26&#39;,\n &#39;lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39;to thee i send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;to witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39;duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;may make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39;but that i hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#39;in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it&#39;,\n &#39;till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39;points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39;and puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39;to show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39;then may i dare to boast how i do love thee&#39;,\n &#39;till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;27&#39;,\n &#39;weary with toil i haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39;the dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39;but then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#39;to work my mind when bodys works expired&#39;,\n &#39;for then my thoughts from far where i abide&#39;,\n &#39;intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39;and keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39;looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#39;save that my souls imaginary sight&#39;,\n &#39;presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39;which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39;makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39;lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39;for thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;28&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;that am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#39;when days oppression is not eased by night&#39;,\n &#39;but day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#39;and each though enemies to eithers reign&#39;,\n &#39;do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39;the one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;how far i toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39;i tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39;and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39;so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night&#39;,\n &#39;when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even&#39;,\n &#39;but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#39;and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;29&#39;,\n &#39;when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes&#39;,\n &#39;i all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39;and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39;and look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39;wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39;featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#39;desiring this mans art and that mans scope&#39;,\n &#39;with what i most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39;yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39;haply i think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39;like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#39;from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate&#39;,\n &#39;for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39;that then i scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;30&#39;,\n &#39;when to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39;i summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39;i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought&#39;,\n &#39;and with old woes new wail my dear times waste&#39;,\n &#39;then can i drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#39;for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night&#39;,\n &#39;and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe&#39;,\n &#39;and moan th expense of many a vanished sight&#39;,\n &#39;then can i grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#39;and heavily from woe to woe tell oer&#39;,\n &#39;the sad account of forebemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39;which i new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39;but if the while i think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39;all losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;31&#39;,\n &#39;thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39;which i by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#39;and there reigns love and all loves loving parts&#39;,\n &#39;and all those friends which i thought buried&#39;,\n &#39;how many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#39;hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye&#39;,\n &#39;as interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39;but things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39;thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39;hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39;who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39;that due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39;their images i loved i view in thee&#39;,\n &#39;and thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;32&#39;,\n &#39;if thou survive my wellcontented day&#39;,\n &#39;when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;and shalt by fortune once more resurvey&#39;,\n &#39;these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#39;compare them with the bettring of the time&#39;,\n &#39;and though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39;reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39;o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#39;had my friends muse grown with this growing age&#39;,\n &#39;a dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;to march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39;but since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#39;theirs for their style ill read his for his love&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;33&#39;,\n &#39;full many a glorious morning have i seen&#39;,\n &#39;flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39;kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39;gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39;anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39;with ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39;and from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39;with all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39;but out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39;the region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39;yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#39;suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;34&#39;,\n &#39;why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39;and make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#39;to let base clouds oertake me in my way&#39;,\n &#39;hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke&#39;,\n &#39;tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#39;,\n &#39;to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face&#39;,\n &#39;for no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39;that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39;though thou repent yet i have still the loss&#39;,\n &#39;th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief&#39;,\n &#39;to him that bears the strong offences cross&#39;,\n &#39;ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39;and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;35&#39;,\n &#39;no more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39;roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39;clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39;and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39;all men make faults and even i in this&#39;,\n &#39;authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39;my self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39;excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39;for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39;thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#39;and gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#39;,\n &#39;such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39;that i an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39;to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;36&#39;,\n &#39;let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39;although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39;so shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39;without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39;in our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39;though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#39;which though it alter not loves sole effect&#39;,\n &#39;yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight&#39;,\n &#39;i may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39;lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39;nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39;unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39;but do not so i love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39;as thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;37&#39;,\n &#39;as a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39;to see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#39;so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite&#39;,\n &#39;take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39;for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39;or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39;entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39;i make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39;so then i am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39;whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39;that i in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39;and by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39;look what is best that best i wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39;this wish i have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;38&#39;,\n &#39;how can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#39;while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse&#39;,\n &#39;thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39;for every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;o give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39;worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee&#39;,\n &#39;when thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39;be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39;and he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39;if my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39;the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;39&#39;,\n &#39;o how thy worth with manners may i sing&#39;,\n &#39;when thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39;what can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#39;and what ist but mine own when i praise thee&#39;,\n &#39;even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39;and our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39;that by this separation i may give&#39;,\n &#39;that due to thee which thou deservst alone&#39;,\n &#39;o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39;were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39;to entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39;which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39;and that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39;by praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;40&#39;,\n &#39;take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39;what hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39;no love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39;all mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39;then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39;i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39;but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;by wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39;i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39;and yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#39;to bear greater wrong than hates known injury&#39;,\n &#39;lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39;kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;41&#39;,\n &#39;those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39;when i am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39;thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39;for still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39;gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39;beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#39;and when a woman woos what womans son&#39;,\n &#39;will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39;ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39;and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39;who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39;hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39;thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;42&#39;,\n &#39;that thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39;and yet it may be said i loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39;that she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39;a loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39;loving offenders thus i will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#39;thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her&#39;,\n &#39;and for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#39;suffring my friend for my sake to approve her&#39;,\n &#39;if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain&#39;,\n &#39;and losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39;both find each other and i lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39;and both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#39;but heres the joy my friend and i are one&#39;,\n &#39;sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;43&#39;,\n &#39;when most i wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39;for all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39;but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39;and darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39;then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#39;how would thy shadows form form happy show&#39;,\n &#39;to the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39;when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39;how would i say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39;by looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39;when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39;through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39;all days are nights to see till i see thee&#39;,\n &#39;and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;44&#39;,\n &#39;if the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39;injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39;for then despite of space i would be brought&#39;,\n &#39;from limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39;no matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39;for nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39;as soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39;but ah thought kills me that i am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39;but that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#39;i must attend times leisure with my moan&#39;,\n &#39;receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#39;but heavy tears badges of eithers woe&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;45&#39;,\n &#39;the other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39;are both with thee wherever i abide&#39;,\n &#39;the first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39;these presentabsent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39;for when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;in tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39;my life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39;sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#39;until lifes composition be recured&#39;,\n &#39;by those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39;who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39;of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39;this told i joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39;i send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;46&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39;how to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar&#39;,\n &#39;my heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39;my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39;a closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39;but the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39;and says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39;to side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39;and by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#39;the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part&#39;,\n &#39;as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part&#39;,\n &#39;and my hearts right thy inward love of heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;47&#39;,\n &#39;betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39;and each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39;when that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39;or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#39;with my loves picture then my eye doth feast&#39;,\n &#39;and to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#39;another time mine eye is my hearts guest&#39;,\n &#39;and in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39;so either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39;thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39;for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39;and i am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39;or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#39;awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;48&#39;,\n &#39;how careful was i when i took my way&#39;,\n &#39;each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39;that to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39;but thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39;most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39;thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39;art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39;thee have i not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39;save where thou art not though i feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39;within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39;from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#39;and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear&#39;,\n &#39;for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;49&#39;,\n &#39;against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39;when i shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39;when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum&#39;,\n &#39;called to that audit by advised respects&#39;,\n &#39;against that time when thou shalt strangely pass&#39;,\n &#39;and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye&#39;,\n &#39;when love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;shall reasons find of settled gravity&#39;,\n &#39;against that time do i ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;within the knowledge of mine own desert&#39;,\n &#39;and this my hand against my self uprear&#39;,\n &#39;to guard the lawful reasons on thy part&#39;,\n &#39;to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws&#39;,\n &#39;since why to love i can allege no cause&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;50&#39;,\n &#39;how heavy do i journey on the way&#39;,\n &#39;when what i seek my weary travels end&#39;,\n &#39;doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#39;thus far the miles are measured from thy friend&#39;,\n &#39;the beast that bears me tired with my woe&#39;,\n &#39;plods dully on to bear that weight in me&#39;,\n &#39;as if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;his rider loved not speed being made from thee&#39;,\n &#39;the bloody spur cannot provoke him on&#39;,\n &#39;that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide&#39;,\n &#39;which heavily he answers with a groan&#39;,\n &#39;more sharp to me than spurring to his side&#39;,\n &#39;for that same groan doth put this in my mind&#39;,\n &#39;my grief lies onward and my joy behind&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;51&#39;,\n &#39;thus can my love excuse the slow offence&#39;,\n &#39;of my dull bearer when from thee i speed&#39;,\n &#39;from where thou art why should i haste me thence&#39;,\n &#39;till i return of posting is no need&#39;,\n &#39;o what excuse will my poor beast then find&#39;,\n &#39;when swift extremity can seem but slow&#39;,\n &#39;then should i spur though mounted on the wind&#39;,\n &#39;in winged speed no motion shall i know&#39;,\n &#39;then can no horse with my desire keep pace&#39;,\n &#39;therefore desire of perfectst love being made&#39;,\n &#39;shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race&#39;,\n &#39;but love for love thus shall excuse my jade&#39;,\n &#39;since from thee going he went wilfulslow&#39;,\n &#39;towards thee ill run and give him leave to go&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;52&#39;,\n &#39;so am i as the rich whose blessed key&#39;,\n &#39;can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure&#39;,\n &#39;the which he will not every hour survey&#39;,\n &#39;for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare&#39;,\n &#39;since seldom coming in that long year set&#39;,\n &#39;like stones of worth they thinly placed are&#39;,\n &#39;or captain jewels in the carcanet&#39;,\n &#39;so is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide&#39;,\n &#39;to make some special instant specialblest&#39;,\n &#39;by new unfolding his imprisoned pride&#39;,\n &#39;blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope&#39;,\n &#39;being had to triumph being lacked to hope&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;53&#39;,\n &#39;what is your substance whereof are you made&#39;,\n &#39;that millions of strange shadows on you tend&#39;,\n &#39;since every one hath every one one shade&#39;,\n &#39;and you but one can every shadow lend&#39;,\n &#39;describe adonis and the counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;is poorly imitated after you&#39;,\n &#39;on helens cheek all art of beauty set&#39;,\n &#39;and you in grecian tires are painted new&#39;,\n &#39;speak of the spring and foison of the year&#39;,\n &#39;the one doth shadow of your beauty show&#39;,\n &#39;the other as your bounty doth appear&#39;,\n &#39;and you in every blessed shape we know&#39;,\n &#39;in all external grace you have some part&#39;,\n &#39;but you like none none you for constant heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;54&#39;,\n &#39;o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem&#39;,\n &#39;by that sweet ornament which truth doth give&#39;,\n &#39;the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;for that sweet odour which doth in it live&#39;,\n &#39;the canker blooms have full as deep a dye&#39;,\n &#39;as the perfumed tincture of the roses&#39;,\n &#39;hang on such thorns and play as wantonly&#39;,\n &#39;when summers breath their masked buds discloses&#39;,\n &#39;but for their virtue only is their show&#39;,\n &#39;they live unwooed and unrespected fade&#39;,\n &#39;die to themselves sweet roses do not so&#39;,\n &#39;of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made&#39;,\n &#39;and so of you beauteous and lovely youth&#39;,\n &#39;when that shall fade my verse distills your truth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;55&#39;,\n &#39;not marble nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;but you shall shine more bright in these contents&#39;,\n &#39;than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time&#39;,\n &#39;when wasteful war shall statues overturn&#39;,\n &#39;and broils root out the work of masonry&#39;,\n &#39;nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn&#39;,\n &#39;the living record of your memory&#39;,\n &#39;gainst death and alloblivious enmity&#39;,\n &#39;shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room&#39;,\n &#39;even in the eyes of all posterity&#39;,\n &#39;that wear this world out to the ending doom&#39;,\n &#39;so till the judgment that your self arise&#39;,\n &#39;you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;56&#39;,\n &#39;sweet love renew thy force be it not said&#39;,\n &#39;thy edge should blunter be than appetite&#39;,\n &#39;which but today by feeding is allayed&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow sharpened in his former might&#39;,\n &#39;so love be thou although today thou fill&#39;,\n &#39;thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow see again and do not kill&#39;,\n &#39;the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness&#39;,\n &#39;let this sad interim like the ocean be&#39;,\n &#39;which parts the shore where two contracted new&#39;,\n &#39;come daily to the banks that when they see&#39;,\n &#39;return of love more blest may be the view&#39;,\n &#39;or call it winter which being full of care&#39;,\n &#39;makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n

do till you require&#39;,\n &#39;nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you&#39;,\n &#39;nor think the bitterness of absence sour&#39;,\n &#39;when you have bid your servant once adieu&#39;,\n &#39;nor dare i question with my jealous thought&#39;,\n &#39;where you may be or your affairs suppose&#39;,\n &#39;but like a sad slave stay and think of nought&#39;,\n &#39;save where you are how happy you make those&#39;,\n &#39;so true a fool is love that in your will&#39;,\n &#39;though you do any thing he thinks no ill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;58&#39;,\n &#39;that god forbid that made me first your slave&#39;,\n &#39;i should in thought control your times of pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;or at your hand th account

&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;2&#39;,\n &#39;when forty winters shall besiege thy brow&#39;,\n &#39;and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field&#39;,\n &#39;thy youths proud livery so gazed on now&#39;,\n &#39;will be a tattered weed of small worth held&#39;,\n &#39;then being asked where all thy beauty lies&#39;,\n &#39;where all the treasure of thy lusty days&#39;,\n &#39;to say within thine own deep sunken eyes&#39;,\n &#39;were an alleating shame and thriftless praise&#39;,\n &#39;how much more praise deserved thy beautys use&#39;,\n &#39;if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine&#39;,\n &#39;shall sum my count and make my old excuse&#39;,\n &#39;proving his beauty by succession thine&#39;,\n &#39;this were to be new made when thou art old&#39;,\n &#39;and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;3&#39;,\n &#39;look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest&#39;,\n &#39;now is the time that face should form another&#39;,\n &#39;whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest&#39;,\n &#39;thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother&#39;,\n &#39;for where is she so fair whose uneared womb&#39;,\n &#39;disdains the tillage of thy husbandry&#39;,\n &#39;or who is he so fond will be the tomb&#39;,\n &#39;of his selflove to stop posterity&#39;,\n &#39;thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee&#39;,\n &#39;calls back the lovely april of her prime&#39;,\n &#39;so thou through windows of thine age shalt see&#39;,\n &#39;despite of wrinkles this thy golden time&#39;,\n &#39;but if thou live remembered not to be&#39;,\n &#39;die single and thine image dies with thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;4&#39;,\n &#39;unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend&#39;,\n &#39;upon thy self thy beautys legacy&#39;,\n &#39;natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend&#39;,\n &#39;and being frank she lends to those are free&#39;,\n &#39;then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse&#39;,\n &#39;the bounteous largess given thee to give&#39;,\n &#39;profitless usurer why dost thou use&#39;,\n &#39;so great a sum of sums yet canst not live&#39;,\n &#39;for having traffic with thy self alone&#39;,\n &#39;thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive&#39;,\n &#39;then how when nature calls thee to be gone&#39;,\n &#39;what acceptable audit canst thou leave&#39;,\n &#39;thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee&#39;,\n &#39;which used lives th executor to be&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;5&#39;,\n &#39;those hours that with gentle work did frame&#39;,\n &#39;the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell&#39;,\n &#39;will play the tyrants to the very same&#39;,\n &#39;and that unfair which fairly doth excel&#39;,\n &#39;for neverresting time leads summer on&#39;,\n &#39;to hideous winter and confounds him there&#39;,\n &#39;sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone&#39;,\n &#39;beauty oersnowed and bareness every where&#39;,\n &#39;then were not summers distillation left&#39;,\n &#39;a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass&#39;,\n &#39;beautys effect with beauty were bereft&#39;,\n &#39;nor it nor no remembrance what it was&#39;,\n &#39;but flowers distilled though they with winter meet&#39;,\n &#39;leese but their show their substance still lives sweet&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;6&#39;,\n &#39;then let not winters ragged hand deface&#39;,\n &#39;in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled&#39;,\n &#39;make sweet some vial treasure thou some place&#39;,\n &#39;with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled&#39;,\n &#39;that use is not forbidden usury&#39;,\n &#39;which happies those that pay the willing loan&#39;,\n &#39;thats for thy self to breed another thee&#39;,\n &#39;or ten times happier be it ten for one&#39;,\n &#39;ten times thy self were happier than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;if ten of thine ten times refigured thee&#39;,\n &#39;then what could death do if thou shouldst depart&#39;,\n &#39;leaving thee living in posterity&#39;,\n &#39;be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair&#39;,\n &#39;to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;7&#39;,\n &#39;lo in the orient when the gracious light&#39;,\n &#39;lifts up his burning head each under eye&#39;,\n &#39;doth homage to his newappearing sight&#39;,\n &#39;serving with looks his sacred majesty&#39;,\n &#39;and having climbed the steepup heavenly hill&#39;,\n &#39;resembling strong youth in his middle age&#39;,\n &#39;yet mortal looks adore his beauty still&#39;,\n &#39;attending on his golden pilgrimage&#39;,\n &#39;but when from highmost pitch with weary car&#39;,\n &#39;like feeble age he reeleth from the day&#39;,\n &#39;the eyes fore duteous now converted are&#39;,\n &#39;from his low tract and look another way&#39;,\n &#39;so thou thy self outgoing in thy noon&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked on diest unless thou get a son&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;8&#39;,\n &#39;music to hear why hearst thou music sadly&#39;,\n &#39;sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy&#39;,\n &#39;why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly&#39;,\n &#39;or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy&#39;,\n &#39;if the true concord of welltuned sounds&#39;,\n &#39;by unions married do offend thine ear&#39;,\n &#39;they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds&#39;,\n &#39;in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39;mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39;strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39;resembling sire and child and happy mother&#39;,\n &#39;who all in one one pleasing note do sing&#39;,\n &#39;whose speechless song being many seeming one&#39;,\n &#39;sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;9&#39;,\n &#39;is it for fear to wet a widows eye&#39;,\n &#39;that thou consumst thy self in single life&#39;,\n &#39;ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die&#39;,\n &#39;the world will wail thee like a makeless wife&#39;,\n &#39;the world will be thy widow and still weep&#39;,\n &#39;that thou no form of thee hast left behind&#39;,\n &#39;when every private widow well may keep&#39;,\n &#39;by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind&#39;,\n &#39;look what an unthrift in the world doth spend&#39;,\n &#39;shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it&#39;,\n &#39;but beautys waste hath in the world an end&#39;,\n &#39;and kept unused the user so destroys it&#39;,\n &#39;no love toward others in that bosom sits&#39;,\n &#39;that on himself such murdrous shame commits&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;10&#39;,\n &#39;for shame deny that thou bearst love to any&#39;,\n &#39;who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39;grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#39;but that thou none lovst is most evident&#39;,\n &#39;for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate&#39;,\n &#39;that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire&#39;,\n &#39;seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39;o change thy thought that i may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39;shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39;be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39;or to thy self at least kindhearted prove&#39;,\n &#39;make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39;that beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;11&#39;,\n &#39;as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;in one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#39;and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst&#39;,\n &#39;thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39;herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39;without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39;if all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39;and threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39;let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39;harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39;look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39;which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39;she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39;thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;12&#39;,\n &#39;when i do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39;and see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39;when i behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#39;and sable curls all silvered oer with white&#39;,\n &#39;when lofty trees i see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39;which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#39;and summers green all girded up in sheaves&#39;,\n &#39;borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39;then of thy beauty do i question make&#39;,\n &#39;that thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39;since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39;and die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#39;and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence&#39;,\n &#39;save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;13&#39;,\n &#39;o that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;no longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39;against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39;and your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39;so should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#39;your self again after your selfs decease&#39;,\n &#39;when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39;who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39;which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#39;against the stormy gusts of winters day&#39;,\n &#39;and barren rage of deaths eternal cold&#39;,\n &#39;o none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39;you had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;14&#39;,\n &#39;not from the stars do i my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39;and yet methinks i have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39;but not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#39;of plagues of dearths or seasons quality&#39;,\n &#39;nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39;pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39;or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;by oft predict that i in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39;but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive&#39;,\n &#39;and constant stars in them i read such art&#39;,\n &#39;as truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39;or else of thee this i prognosticate&#39;,\n &#39;thy end is truths and beautys doom and date&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;15&#39;,\n &#39;when i consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39;that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39;when i perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39;cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky&#39;,\n &#39;vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39;and wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39;then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39;sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39;where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;to change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39;and all in war with time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39;as he takes from you i engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;16&#39;,\n &#39;but wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;make war upon this bloody tyrant time&#39;,\n &#39;and fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;with means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39;and many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39;with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39;much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;so should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#39;which this times pencil or my pupil pen&#39;,\n &#39;neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39;to give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39;and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;17&#39;,\n &#39;who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;if it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39;though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39;if i could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39;and in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39;the age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#39;such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces&#39;,\n &#39;so should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39;be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#39;and your true rights be termed a poets rage&#39;,\n &#39;and stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39;but were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39;you should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;18&#39;,\n &#39;shall i compare thee to a summers day&#39;,\n &#39;thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39;rough winds do shake the darling buds of may&#39;,\n &#39;and summers lease hath all too short a date&#39;,\n &#39;sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39;and often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#39;by chance or natures changing course untrimmed&#39;,\n &#39;but thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#39;nor lose possession of that fair thou owst&#39;,\n &#39;nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade&#39;,\n &#39;when in eternal lines to time thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;so long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39;so long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;19&#39;,\n &#39;devouring time blunt thou the lions paws&#39;,\n &#39;and make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#39;pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws&#39;,\n &#39;and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#39;make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst&#39;,\n &#39;and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time&#39;,\n &#39;to the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39;but i forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#39;o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow&#39;,\n &#39;nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39;him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#39;for beautys pattern to succeeding men&#39;,\n &#39;yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39;my love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;20&#39;,\n &#39;a womans face with natures own hand painted&#39;,\n &#39;hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#39;a womans gentle heart but not acquainted&#39;,\n &#39;with shifting change as is false womens fashion&#39;,\n &#39;an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39;gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39;a man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#39;which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth&#39;,\n &#39;and for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39;till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting&#39;,\n &#39;and by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39;by adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#39;but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;21&#39;,\n &#39;so is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39;stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39;who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#39;with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems&#39;,\n &#39;with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare&#39;,\n &#39;that heavens air in this huge rondure hems&#39;,\n &#39;o let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39;and then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#39;as any mothers child though not so bright&#39;,\n &#39;as those gold candles fixed in heavens air&#39;,\n &#39;let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39;i will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;22&#39;,\n &#39;my glass shall not persuade me i am old&#39;,\n &#39;so long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#39;but when in thee times furrows i behold&#39;,\n &#39;then look i death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39;for all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39;is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;o therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39;as i not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39;bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;as tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39;presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#39;thou gavst me thine not to give back again&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;23&#39;,\n &#39;as an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39;who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39;or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#39;whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart&#39;,\n &#39;so i for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#39;the perfect ceremony of loves rite&#39;,\n &#39;and in mine own loves strength seem to decay&#39;,\n &#39;oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might&#39;,\n &#39;o let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39;and dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39;who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39;more than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39;o learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#39;to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;24&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#39;thy beautys form in table of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;my body is the frame wherein tis held&#39;,\n &#39;and perspective it is best painters art&#39;,\n &#39;for through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39;to find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#39;which in my bosoms shop is hanging still&#39;,\n &#39;that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39;now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39;mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun&#39;,\n &#39;delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39;yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39;they draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;25&#39;,\n &#39;let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39;of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked for joy in that i honour most&#39;,\n &#39;great princes favourites their fair leaves spread&#39;,\n &#39;but as the marigold at the suns eye&#39;,\n &#39;and in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39;for at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39;the painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39;after a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39;is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39;and all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39;then happy i that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;where i may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;26&#39;,\n &#39;lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39;to thee i send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;to witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39;duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;may make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39;but that i hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#39;in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it&#39;,\n &#39;till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39;points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39;and puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39;to show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39;then may i dare to boast how i do love thee&#39;,\n &#39;till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;27&#39;,\n &#39;weary with toil i haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39;the dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39;but then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#39;to work my mind when bodys works expired&#39;,\n &#39;for then my thoughts from far where i abide&#39;,\n &#39;intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39;and keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39;looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#39;save that my souls imaginary sight&#39;,\n &#39;presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39;which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39;makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39;lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39;for thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;28&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;that am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#39;when days oppression is not eased by night&#39;,\n &#39;but day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#39;and each though enemies to eithers reign&#39;,\n &#39;do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39;the one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;how far i toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39;i tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39;and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39;so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night&#39;,\n &#39;when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even&#39;,\n &#39;but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#39;and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;29&#39;,\n &#39;when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes&#39;,\n &#39;i all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39;and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39;and look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39;wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39;featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#39;desiring this mans art and that mans scope&#39;,\n &#39;with what i most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39;yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39;haply i think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39;like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#39;from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate&#39;,\n &#39;for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39;that then i scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;30&#39;,\n &#39;when to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39;i summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39;i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought&#39;,\n &#39;and with old woes new wail my dear times waste&#39;,\n &#39;then can i drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#39;for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night&#39;,\n &#39;and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe&#39;,\n &#39;and moan th expense of many a vanished sight&#39;,\n &#39;then can i grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#39;and heavily from woe to woe tell oer&#39;,\n &#39;the sad account of forebemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39;which i new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39;but if the while i think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39;all losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;31&#39;,\n &#39;thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39;which i by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#39;and there reigns love and all loves loving parts&#39;,\n &#39;and all those friends which i thought buried&#39;,\n &#39;how many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#39;hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye&#39;,\n &#39;as interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39;but things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39;thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39;hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39;who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39;that due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39;their images i loved i view in thee&#39;,\n &#39;and thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;32&#39;,\n &#39;if thou survive my wellcontented day&#39;,\n &#39;when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;and shalt by fortune once more resurvey&#39;,\n &#39;these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#39;compare them with the bettring of the time&#39;,\n &#39;and though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39;reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39;o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#39;had my friends muse grown with this growing age&#39;,\n &#39;a dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;to march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39;but since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#39;theirs for their style ill read his for his love&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;33&#39;,\n &#39;full many a glorious morning have i seen&#39;,\n &#39;flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39;kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39;gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39;anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39;with ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39;and from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39;with all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39;but out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39;the region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39;yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#39;suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;34&#39;,\n &#39;why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39;and make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#39;to let base clouds oertake me in my way&#39;,\n &#39;hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke&#39;,\n &#39;tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#39;,\n &#39;to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face&#39;,\n &#39;for no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39;that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39;though thou repent yet i have still the loss&#39;,\n &#39;th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief&#39;,\n &#39;to him that bears the strong offences cross&#39;,\n &#39;ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39;and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;35&#39;,\n &#39;no more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39;roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39;clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39;and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39;all men make faults and even i in this&#39;,\n &#39;authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39;my self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39;excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39;for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39;thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#39;and gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#39;,\n &#39;such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39;that i an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39;to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;36&#39;,\n &#39;let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39;although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39;so shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39;without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39;in our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39;though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#39;which though it alter not loves sole effect&#39;,\n &#39;yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight&#39;,\n &#39;i may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39;lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39;nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39;unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39;but do not so i love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39;as thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;37&#39;,\n &#39;as a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39;to see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#39;so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite&#39;,\n &#39;take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39;for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39;or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39;entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39;i make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39;so then i am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39;whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39;that i in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39;and by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39;look what is best that best i wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39;this wish i have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;38&#39;,\n &#39;how can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#39;while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse&#39;,\n &#39;thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39;for every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;o give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39;worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee&#39;,\n &#39;when thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39;be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39;and he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39;if my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39;the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;39&#39;,\n &#39;o how thy worth with manners may i sing&#39;,\n &#39;when thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39;what can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#39;and what ist but mine own when i praise thee&#39;,\n &#39;even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39;and our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39;that by this separation i may give&#39;,\n &#39;that due to thee which thou deservst alone&#39;,\n &#39;o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39;were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39;to entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39;which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39;and that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39;by praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;40&#39;,\n &#39;take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39;what hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39;no love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39;all mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39;then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39;i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39;but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;by wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39;i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39;and yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#39;to bear greater wrong than hates known injury&#39;,\n &#39;lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39;kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;41&#39;,\n &#39;those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39;when i am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39;thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39;for still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39;gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39;beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#39;and when a woman woos what womans son&#39;,\n &#39;will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39;ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39;and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39;who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39;hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39;thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;42&#39;,\n &#39;that thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39;and yet it may be said i loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39;that she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39;a loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39;loving offenders thus i will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#39;thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her&#39;,\n &#39;and for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#39;suffring my friend for my sake to approve her&#39;,\n &#39;if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain&#39;,\n &#39;and losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39;both find each other and i lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39;and both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#39;but heres the joy my friend and i are one&#39;,\n &#39;sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;43&#39;,\n &#39;when most i wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39;for all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39;but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39;and darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39;then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#39;how would thy shadows form form happy show&#39;,\n &#39;to the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39;when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39;how would i say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39;by looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39;when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39;through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39;all days are nights to see till i see thee&#39;,\n &#39;and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;44&#39;,\n &#39;if the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39;injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39;for then despite of space i would be brought&#39;,\n &#39;from limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39;no matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39;for nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39;as soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39;but ah thought kills me that i am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39;but that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#39;i must attend times leisure with my moan&#39;,\n &#39;receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#39;but heavy tears badges of eithers woe&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;45&#39;,\n &#39;the other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39;are both with thee wherever i abide&#39;,\n &#39;the first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39;these presentabsent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39;for when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;in tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39;my life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39;sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#39;until lifes composition be recured&#39;,\n &#39;by those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39;who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39;of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39;this told i joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39;i send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;46&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39;how to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar&#39;,\n &#39;my heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39;my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39;a closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39;but the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39;and says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39;to side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39;and by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#39;the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part&#39;,\n &#39;as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part&#39;,\n &#39;and my hearts right thy inward love of heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;47&#39;,\n &#39;betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39;and each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39;when that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39;or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#39;with my loves picture then my eye doth feast&#39;,\n &#39;and to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#39;another time mine eye is my hearts guest&#39;,\n &#39;and in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39;so either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39;thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39;for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39;and i am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39;or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#39;awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;48&#39;,\n &#39;how careful was i when i took my way&#39;,\n &#39;each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39;that to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39;but thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39;most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39;thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39;art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39;thee have i not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39;save where thou art not though i feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39;within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39;from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#39;and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear&#39;,\n &#39;for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;49&#39;,\n &#39;against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39;when i shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39;when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum&#39;,\n &#39;called to that audit by advised respects&#39;,\n &#39;against that time when thou shalt strangely pass&#39;,\n &#39;and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye&#39;,\n &#39;when love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;shall reasons find of settled gravity&#39;,\n &#39;against that time do i ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;within the knowledge of mine own desert&#39;,\n &#39;and this my hand against my self uprear&#39;,\n &#39;to guard the lawful reasons on thy part&#39;,\n &#39;to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws&#39;,\n &#39;since why to love i can allege no cause&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;50&#39;,\n &#39;how heavy do i journey on the way&#39;,\n &#39;when what i seek my weary travels end&#39;,\n &#39;doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#39;thus far the miles are measured from thy friend&#39;,\n &#39;the beast that bears me tired with my woe&#39;,\n &#39;plods dully on to bear that weight in me&#39;,\n &#39;as if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;his rider loved not speed being made from thee&#39;,\n &#39;the bloody spur cannot provoke him on&#39;,\n &#39;that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide&#39;,\n &#39;which heavily he answers with a groan&#39;,\n &#39;more sharp to me than spurring to his side&#39;,\n &#39;for that same groan doth put this in my mind&#39;,\n &#39;my grief lies onward and my joy behind&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;51&#39;,\n &#39;thus can my love excuse the slow offence&#39;,\n &#39;of my dull bearer when from thee i speed&#39;,\n &#39;from where thou art why should i haste me thence&#39;,\n &#39;till i return of posting is no need&#39;,\n &#39;o what excuse will my poor beast then find&#39;,\n &#39;when swift extremity can seem but slow&#39;,\n &#39;then should i spur though mounted on the wind&#39;,\n &#39;in winged speed no motion shall i know&#39;,\n &#39;then can no horse with my desire keep pace&#39;,\n &#39;therefore desire of perfectst love being made&#39;,\n &#39;shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race&#39;,\n &#39;but love for love thus shall excuse my jade&#39;,\n &#39;since from thee going he went wilfulslow&#39;,\n &#39;towards thee ill run and give him leave to go&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;52&#39;,\n &#39;so am i as the rich whose blessed key&#39;,\n &#39;can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure&#39;,\n &#39;the which he will not every hour survey&#39;,\n &#39;for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare&#39;,\n &#39;since seldom coming in that long year set&#39;,\n &#39;like stones of worth they thinly placed are&#39;,\n &#39;or captain jewels in the carcanet&#39;,\n &#39;so is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide&#39;,\n &#39;to make some special instant specialblest&#39;,\n &#39;by new unfolding his imprisoned pride&#39;,\n &#39;blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope&#39;,\n &#39;being had to triumph being lacked to hope&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;53&#39;,\n &#39;what is your substance whereof are you made&#39;,\n &#39;that millions of strange shadows on you tend&#39;,\n &#39;since every one hath every one one shade&#39;,\n &#39;and you but one can every shadow lend&#39;,\n &#39;describe adonis and the counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;is poorly imitated after you&#39;,\n &#39;on helens cheek all art of beauty set&#39;,\n &#39;and you in grecian tires are painted new&#39;,\n &#39;speak of the spring and foison of the year&#39;,\n &#39;the one doth shadow of your beauty show&#39;,\n &#39;the other as your bounty doth appear&#39;,\n &#39;and you in every blessed shape we know&#39;,\n &#39;in all external grace you have some part&#39;,\n &#39;but you like none none you for constant heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;54&#39;,\n &#39;o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem&#39;,\n &#39;by that sweet ornament which truth doth give&#39;,\n &#39;the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;for that sweet odour which doth in it live&#39;,\n &#39;the canker blooms have full as deep a dye&#39;,\n &#39;as the perfumed tincture of the roses&#39;,\n &#39;hang on such thorns and play as wantonly&#39;,\n &#39;when summers breath their masked buds discloses&#39;,\n &#39;but for their virtue only is their show&#39;,\n &#39;they live unwooed and unrespected fade&#39;,\n &#39;die to themselves sweet roses do not so&#39;,\n &#39;of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made&#39;,\n &#39;and so of you beauteous and lovely youth&#39;,\n &#39;when that shall fade my verse distills your truth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;55&#39;,\n &#39;not marble nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;of

&#39;in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear&#39;,\n &#39;mark how one string sweet husband to another&#39;,\n &#39;strikes each in each by mutual ordering&#39;,\n &#39;resembling sire and

himself such murdrous shame commits&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;10&#39;,\n &#39;for shame deny that thou bearst love to any&#39;,\n &#39;who for thy self art so unprovident&#39;,\n &#39;grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many&#39;,\n &#39;but that thou none lovst is most evident&#39;,\n &#39;for thou art so possessed with murdrous hate&#39;,\n &#39;that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire&#39;,\n &#39;seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate&#39;,\n &#39;which to repair should be thy chief desire&#39;,\n &#39;o change thy thought that i may change my mind&#39;,\n &#39;shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love&#39;,\n &#39;be as thy presence is gracious and kind&#39;,\n &#39;or to thy self at least kindhearted prove&#39;,\n &#39;make thee another self for love of me&#39;,\n &#39;that beauty still may live in thine or thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;11&#39;,\n &#39;as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;in one of thine from that which thou departest&#39;,\n &#39;and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst&#39;,\n &#39;thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest&#39;,\n &#39;herein lives wisdom beauty and increase&#39;,\n &#39;without this folly age and cold decay&#39;,\n &#39;if all were minded so the times should cease&#39;,\n &#39;and threescore year would make the world away&#39;,\n &#39;let those whom nature hath not made for store&#39;,\n &#39;harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish&#39;,\n &#39;look whom she best endowed she gave thee more&#39;,\n &#39;which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish&#39;,\n &#39;she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby&#39;,\n &#39;thou shouldst print more not let that copy die&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;12&#39;,\n &#39;when i do count the clock that tells the time&#39;,\n &#39;and see the brave day sunk in hideous night&#39;,\n &#39;when i behold the violet past prime&#39;,\n &#39;and sable curls all silvered oer with white&#39;,\n &#39;when lofty trees i see barren of leaves&#39;,\n &#39;which erst from heat did canopy the herd&#39;,\n &#39;and summers green all girded up in sheaves&#39;,\n &#39;borne on the bier with white and bristly beard&#39;,\n &#39;then of thy beauty do i question make&#39;,\n &#39;that thou among the wastes of time must go&#39;,\n &#39;since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake&#39;,\n &#39;and die as fast as they see others grow&#39;,\n &#39;and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence&#39;,\n &#39;save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;13&#39;,\n &#39;o that you were your self but love you are&#39;,\n &#39;no longer yours than you your self here live&#39;,\n &#39;against this coming end you should prepare&#39;,\n &#39;and your sweet semblance to some other give&#39;,\n &#39;so should that beauty which you hold in lease&#39;,\n &#39;find no determination then you were&#39;,\n &#39;your self again after your selfs decease&#39;,\n &#39;when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear&#39;,\n &#39;who lets so fair a house fall to decay&#39;,\n &#39;which husbandry in honour might uphold&#39;,\n &#39;against the stormy gusts of winters day&#39;,\n &#39;and barren rage of deaths eternal cold&#39;,\n &#39;o none but unthrifts dear my love you know&#39;,\n &#39;you had a father let your son say so&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;14&#39;,\n &#39;not from the stars do i my judgement pluck&#39;,\n &#39;and yet methinks i have astronomy&#39;,\n &#39;but not to tell of good or evil luck&#39;,\n &#39;of plagues of dearths or seasons quality&#39;,\n &#39;nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell&#39;,\n &#39;pointing to each his thunder rain and wind&#39;,\n &#39;or say with princes if it shall go well&#39;,\n &#39;by oft predict that i in heaven find&#39;,\n &#39;but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive&#39;,\n &#39;and constant stars in them i read such art&#39;,\n &#39;as truth and beauty shall together thrive&#39;,\n &#39;if from thy self to store thou wouldst convert&#39;,\n &#39;or else of thee this i prognosticate&#39;,\n &#39;thy end is truths and beautys doom and date&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;15&#39;,\n &#39;when i consider every thing that grows&#39;,\n &#39;holds in perfection but a little moment&#39;,\n &#39;that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows&#39;,\n &#39;whereon the stars in secret influence comment&#39;,\n &#39;when i perceive that men as plants increase&#39;,\n &#39;cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky&#39;,\n &#39;vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease&#39;,\n &#39;and wear their brave state out of memory&#39;,\n &#39;then the conceit of this inconstant stay&#39;,\n &#39;sets you most rich in youth before my sight&#39;,\n &#39;where wasteful time debateth with decay&#39;,\n &#39;to change your day of youth to sullied night&#39;,\n &#39;and all in war with time for love of you&#39;,\n &#39;as he takes from you i engraft you new&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;16&#39;,\n &#39;but wherefore do not you a mightier way&#39;,\n &#39;make war upon this bloody tyrant time&#39;,\n &#39;and fortify your self in your decay&#39;,\n &#39;with means more blessed than my barren rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;now stand you on the top of happy hours&#39;,\n &#39;and many maiden gardens yet unset&#39;,\n &#39;with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers&#39;,\n &#39;much liker than your painted counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;so should the lines of life that life repair&#39;,\n &#39;which this times pencil or my pupil pen&#39;,\n &#39;neither in inward worth nor outward fair&#39;,\n &#39;can make you live your self in eyes of men&#39;,\n &#39;to give away your self keeps your self still&#39;,\n &#39;and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;17&#39;,\n &#39;who will believe my verse in time to come&#39;,\n &#39;if it were filled with your most high deserts&#39;,\n &#39;though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&#39;,\n &#39;which hides your life and shows not half your parts&#39;,\n &#39;if i could write the beauty of your eyes&#39;,\n &#39;and in fresh numbers number all your graces&#39;,\n &#39;the age to come would say this poet lies&#39;,\n &#39;such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces&#39;,\n &#39;so should my papers yellowed with their age&#39;,\n &#39;be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue&#39;,\n &#39;and your true rights be termed a poets rage&#39;,\n &#39;and stretched metre of an antique song&#39;,\n &#39;but were some child of yours alive that time&#39;,\n &#39;you should live twice in it and in my rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;18&#39;,\n &#39;shall i compare thee to a summers day&#39;,\n &#39;thou art more lovely and more temperate&#39;,\n &#39;rough winds do shake the darling buds of may&#39;,\n &#39;and summers lease hath all too short a date&#39;,\n &#39;sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines&#39;,\n &#39;and often is his gold complexion dimmed&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair from fair sometime declines&#39;,\n &#39;by chance or natures changing course untrimmed&#39;,\n &#39;but thy eternal summer shall not fade&#39;,\n &#39;nor lose possession of that fair thou owst&#39;,\n &#39;nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade&#39;,\n &#39;when in eternal lines to time thou growst&#39;,\n &#39;so long as men can breathe or eyes can see&#39;,\n &#39;so long lives this and this gives life to thee&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;19&#39;,\n &#39;devouring time blunt thou the lions paws&#39;,\n &#39;and make the earth devour her own sweet brood&#39;,\n &#39;pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws&#39;,\n &#39;and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood&#39;,\n &#39;make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst&#39;,\n &#39;and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time&#39;,\n &#39;to the wide world and all her fading sweets&#39;,\n &#39;but i forbid thee one most heinous crime&#39;,\n &#39;o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow&#39;,\n &#39;nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen&#39;,\n &#39;him in thy course untainted do allow&#39;,\n &#39;for beautys pattern to succeeding men&#39;,\n &#39;yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong&#39;,\n &#39;my love shall in my verse ever live young&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;20&#39;,\n &#39;a womans face with natures own hand painted&#39;,\n &#39;hast thou the master mistress of my passion&#39;,\n &#39;a womans gentle heart but not acquainted&#39;,\n &#39;with shifting change as is false womens fashion&#39;,\n &#39;an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling&#39;,\n &#39;gilding the object whereupon it gazeth&#39;,\n &#39;a man in hue all hues in his controlling&#39;,\n &#39;which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth&#39;,\n &#39;and for a woman wert thou first created&#39;,\n &#39;till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting&#39;,\n &#39;and by addition me of thee defeated&#39;,\n &#39;by adding one thing to my purpose nothing&#39;,\n &#39;but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;21&#39;,\n &#39;so is it not with me as with that muse&#39;,\n &#39;stirred by a painted beauty to his verse&#39;,\n &#39;who heaven it self for ornament doth use&#39;,\n &#39;and every fair with his fair doth rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;making a couplement of proud compare&#39;,\n &#39;with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems&#39;,\n &#39;with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare&#39;,\n &#39;that heavens air in this huge rondure hems&#39;,\n &#39;o let me true in love but truly write&#39;,\n &#39;and then believe me my love is as fair&#39;,\n &#39;as any mothers child though not so bright&#39;,\n &#39;as those gold candles fixed in heavens air&#39;,\n &#39;let them say more that like of hearsay well&#39;,\n &#39;i will not praise that purpose not to sell&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;22&#39;,\n &#39;my glass shall not persuade me i am old&#39;,\n &#39;so long as youth and thou are of one date&#39;,\n &#39;but when in thee times furrows i behold&#39;,\n &#39;then look i death my days should expiate&#39;,\n &#39;for all that beauty that doth cover thee&#39;,\n &#39;is but the seemly raiment of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;which in thy breast doth live as thine in me&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then be elder than thou art&#39;,\n &#39;o therefore love be of thyself so wary&#39;,\n &#39;as i not for my self but for thee will&#39;,\n &#39;bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary&#39;,\n &#39;as tender nurse her babe from faring ill&#39;,\n &#39;presume not on thy heart when mine is slain&#39;,\n &#39;thou gavst me thine not to give back again&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;23&#39;,\n &#39;as an unperfect actor on the stage&#39;,\n &#39;who with his fear is put beside his part&#39;,\n &#39;or some fierce thing replete with too much rage&#39;,\n &#39;whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart&#39;,\n &#39;so i for fear of trust forget to say&#39;,\n &#39;the perfect ceremony of loves rite&#39;,\n &#39;and in mine own loves strength seem to decay&#39;,\n &#39;oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might&#39;,\n &#39;o let my looks be then the eloquence&#39;,\n &#39;and dumb presagers of my speaking breast&#39;,\n &#39;who plead for love and look for recompense&#39;,\n &#39;more than that tongue that more hath more expressed&#39;,\n &#39;o learn to read what silent love hath writ&#39;,\n &#39;to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;24&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled&#39;,\n &#39;thy beautys form in table of my heart&#39;,\n &#39;my body is the frame wherein tis held&#39;,\n &#39;and perspective it is best painters art&#39;,\n &#39;for through the painter must you see his skill&#39;,\n &#39;to find where your true image pictured lies&#39;,\n &#39;which in my bosoms shop is hanging still&#39;,\n &#39;that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes&#39;,\n &#39;now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done&#39;,\n &#39;mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me&#39;,\n &#39;are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun&#39;,\n &#39;delights to peep to gaze therein on thee&#39;,\n &#39;yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art&#39;,\n &#39;they draw but what they see know not the heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;25&#39;,\n &#39;let those who are in favour with their stars&#39;,\n &#39;of public honour and proud titles boast&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars&#39;,\n &#39;unlooked for joy in that i honour most&#39;,\n &#39;great princes favourites their fair leaves spread&#39;,\n &#39;but as the marigold at the suns eye&#39;,\n &#39;and in themselves their pride lies buried&#39;,\n &#39;for at a frown they in their glory die&#39;,\n &#39;the painful warrior famoused for fight&#39;,\n &#39;after a thousand victories once foiled&#39;,\n &#39;is from the book of honour razed quite&#39;,\n &#39;and all the rest forgot for which he toiled&#39;,\n &#39;then happy i that love and am beloved&#39;,\n &#39;where i may not remove nor be removed&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;26&#39;,\n &#39;lord of my love to whom in vassalage&#39;,\n &#39;thy merit hath my duty strongly knit&#39;,\n &#39;to thee i send this written embassage&#39;,\n &#39;to witness duty not to show my wit&#39;,\n &#39;duty so great which wit so poor as mine&#39;,\n &#39;may make seem bare in wanting words to show it&#39;,\n &#39;but that i hope some good conceit of thine&#39;,\n &#39;in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it&#39;,\n &#39;till whatsoever star that guides my moving&#39;,\n &#39;points on me graciously with fair aspect&#39;,\n &#39;and puts apparel on my tattered loving&#39;,\n &#39;to show me worthy of thy sweet respect&#39;,\n &#39;then may i dare to boast how i do love thee&#39;,\n &#39;till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;27&#39;,\n &#39;weary with toil i haste me to my bed&#39;,\n &#39;the dear respose for limbs with travel tired&#39;,\n &#39;but then begins a journey in my head&#39;,\n &#39;to work my mind when bodys works expired&#39;,\n &#39;for then my thoughts from far where i abide&#39;,\n &#39;intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee&#39;,\n &#39;and keep my drooping eyelids open wide&#39;,\n &#39;looking on darkness which the blind do see&#39;,\n &#39;save that my souls imaginary sight&#39;,\n &#39;presents thy shadow to my sightless view&#39;,\n &#39;which like a jewel hung in ghastly night&#39;,\n &#39;makes black night beauteous and her old face new&#39;,\n &#39;lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind&#39;,\n &#39;for thee and for my self no quiet find&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;28&#39;,\n &#39;how can i then return in happy plight&#39;,\n &#39;that am debarred the benefit of rest&#39;,\n &#39;when days oppression is not eased by night&#39;,\n &#39;but day by night and night by day oppressed&#39;,\n &#39;and each though enemies to eithers reign&#39;,\n &#39;do in consent shake hands to torture me&#39;,\n &#39;the one by toil the other to complain&#39;,\n &#39;how far i toil still farther off from thee&#39;,\n &#39;i tell the day to please him thou art bright&#39;,\n &#39;and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven&#39;,\n &#39;so flatter i the swartcomplexioned night&#39;,\n &#39;when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even&#39;,\n &#39;but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer&#39;,\n &#39;and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;29&#39;,\n &#39;when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes&#39;,\n &#39;i all alone beweep my outcast state&#39;,\n &#39;and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries&#39;,\n &#39;and look upon my self and curse my fate&#39;,\n &#39;wishing me like to one more rich in hope&#39;,\n &#39;featured like him like him with friends possessed&#39;,\n &#39;desiring this mans art and that mans scope&#39;,\n &#39;with what i most enjoy contented least&#39;,\n &#39;yet in these thoughts my self almost despising&#39;,\n &#39;haply i think on thee and then my state&#39;,\n &#39;like to the lark at break of day arising&#39;,\n &#39;from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate&#39;,\n &#39;for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings&#39;,\n &#39;that then i scorn to change my state with kings&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;30&#39;,\n &#39;when to the sessions of sweet silent thought&#39;,\n &#39;i summon up remembrance of things past&#39;,\n &#39;i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought&#39;,\n &#39;and with old woes new wail my dear times waste&#39;,\n &#39;then can i drown an eye unused to flow&#39;,\n &#39;for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night&#39;,\n &#39;and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe&#39;,\n &#39;and moan th expense of many a vanished sight&#39;,\n &#39;then can i grieve at grievances foregone&#39;,\n &#39;and heavily from woe to woe tell oer&#39;,\n &#39;the sad account of forebemoaned moan&#39;,\n &#39;which i new pay as if not paid before&#39;,\n &#39;but if the while i think on thee dear friend&#39;,\n &#39;all losses are restored and sorrows end&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;31&#39;,\n &#39;thy bosom is endeared with all hearts&#39;,\n &#39;which i by lacking have supposed dead&#39;,\n &#39;and there reigns love and all loves loving parts&#39;,\n &#39;and all those friends which i thought buried&#39;,\n &#39;how many a holy and obsequious tear&#39;,\n &#39;hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye&#39;,\n &#39;as interest of the dead which now appear&#39;,\n &#39;but things removed that hidden in thee lie&#39;,\n &#39;thou art the grave where buried love doth live&#39;,\n &#39;hung with the trophies of my lovers gone&#39;,\n &#39;who all their parts of me to thee did give&#39;,\n &#39;that due of many now is thine alone&#39;,\n &#39;their images i loved i view in thee&#39;,\n &#39;and thou all they hast all the all of me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;32&#39;,\n &#39;if thou survive my wellcontented day&#39;,\n &#39;when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover&#39;,\n &#39;and shalt by fortune once more resurvey&#39;,\n &#39;these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover&#39;,\n &#39;compare them with the bettring of the time&#39;,\n &#39;and though they be outstripped by every pen&#39;,\n &#39;reserve them for my love not for their rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;exceeded by the height of happier men&#39;,\n &#39;o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought&#39;,\n &#39;had my friends muse grown with this growing age&#39;,\n &#39;a dearer birth than this his love had brought&#39;,\n &#39;to march in ranks of better equipage&#39;,\n &#39;but since he died and poets better prove&#39;,\n &#39;theirs for their style ill read his for his love&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;33&#39;,\n &#39;full many a glorious morning have i seen&#39;,\n &#39;flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye&#39;,\n &#39;kissing with golden face the meadows green&#39;,\n &#39;gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy&#39;,\n &#39;anon permit the basest clouds to ride&#39;,\n &#39;with ugly rack on his celestial face&#39;,\n &#39;and from the forlorn world his visage hide&#39;,\n &#39;stealing unseen to west with this disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;even so my sun one early morn did shine&#39;,\n &#39;with all triumphant splendour on my brow&#39;,\n &#39;but out alack he was but one hour mine&#39;,\n &#39;the region cloud hath masked him from me now&#39;,\n &#39;yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth&#39;,\n &#39;suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;34&#39;,\n &#39;why didst thou promise such a beauteous day&#39;,\n &#39;and make me travel forth without my cloak&#39;,\n &#39;to let base clouds oertake me in my way&#39;,\n &#39;hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke&#39;,\n &#39;tis not enough that through the cloud thou break&#39;,\n &#39;to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face&#39;,\n &#39;for no man well of such a salve can speak&#39;,\n &#39;that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace&#39;,\n &#39;nor can thy shame give physic to my grief&#39;,\n &#39;though thou repent yet i have still the loss&#39;,\n &#39;th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief&#39;,\n &#39;to him that bears the strong offences cross&#39;,\n &#39;ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds&#39;,\n &#39;and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;35&#39;,\n &#39;no more be grieved at that which thou hast done&#39;,\n &#39;roses have thorns and silver fountains mud&#39;,\n &#39;clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun&#39;,\n &#39;and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud&#39;,\n &#39;all men make faults and even i in this&#39;,\n &#39;authorizing thy trespass with compare&#39;,\n &#39;my self corrupting salving thy amiss&#39;,\n &#39;excusing thy sins more than thy sins are&#39;,\n &#39;for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense&#39;,\n &#39;thy adverse party is thy advocate&#39;,\n &#39;and gainst my self a lawful plea commence&#39;,\n &#39;such civil war is in my love and hate&#39;,\n &#39;that i an accessary needs must be&#39;,\n &#39;to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;36&#39;,\n &#39;let me confess that we two must be twain&#39;,\n &#39;although our undivided loves are one&#39;,\n &#39;so shall those blots that do with me remain&#39;,\n &#39;without thy help by me be borne alone&#39;,\n &#39;in our two loves there is but one respect&#39;,\n &#39;though in our lives a separable spite&#39;,\n &#39;which though it alter not loves sole effect&#39;,\n &#39;yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight&#39;,\n &#39;i may not evermore acknowledge thee&#39;,\n &#39;lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame&#39;,\n &#39;nor thou with public kindness honour me&#39;,\n &#39;unless thou take that honour from thy name&#39;,\n &#39;but do not so i love thee in such sort&#39;,\n &#39;as thou being mine mine is thy good report&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;37&#39;,\n &#39;as a decrepit father takes delight&#39;,\n &#39;to see his active child do deeds of youth&#39;,\n &#39;so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite&#39;,\n &#39;take all my comfort of thy worth and truth&#39;,\n &#39;for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit&#39;,\n &#39;or any of these all or all or more&#39;,\n &#39;entitled in thy parts do crowned sit&#39;,\n &#39;i make my love engrafted to this store&#39;,\n &#39;so then i am not lame poor nor despised&#39;,\n &#39;whilst that this shadow doth such substance give&#39;,\n &#39;that i in thy abundance am sufficed&#39;,\n &#39;and by a part of all thy glory live&#39;,\n &#39;look what is best that best i wish in thee&#39;,\n &#39;this wish i have then ten times happy me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;38&#39;,\n &#39;how can my muse want subject to invent&#39;,\n &#39;while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse&#39;,\n &#39;thine own sweet argument too excellent&#39;,\n &#39;for every vulgar paper to rehearse&#39;,\n &#39;o give thy self the thanks if aught in me&#39;,\n &#39;worthy perusal stand against thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee&#39;,\n &#39;when thou thy self dost give invention light&#39;,\n &#39;be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth&#39;,\n &#39;than those old nine which rhymers invocate&#39;,\n &#39;and he that calls on thee let him bring forth&#39;,\n &#39;eternal numbers to outlive long date&#39;,\n &#39;if my slight muse do please these curious days&#39;,\n &#39;the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;39&#39;,\n &#39;o how thy worth with manners may i sing&#39;,\n &#39;when thou art all the better part of me&#39;,\n &#39;what can mine own praise to mine own self bring&#39;,\n &#39;and what ist but mine own when i praise thee&#39;,\n &#39;even for this let us divided live&#39;,\n &#39;and our dear love lose name of single one&#39;,\n &#39;that by this separation i may give&#39;,\n &#39;that due to thee which thou deservst alone&#39;,\n &#39;o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove&#39;,\n &#39;were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave&#39;,\n &#39;to entertain the time with thoughts of love&#39;,\n &#39;which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive&#39;,\n &#39;and that thou teachest how to make one twain&#39;,\n &#39;by praising him here who doth hence remain&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;40&#39;,\n &#39;take all my loves my love yea take them all&#39;,\n &#39;what hast thou then more than thou hadst before&#39;,\n &#39;no love my love that thou mayst true love call&#39;,\n &#39;all mine was thine before thou hadst this more&#39;,\n &#39;then if for my love thou my love receivest&#39;,\n &#39;i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest&#39;,\n &#39;but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest&#39;,\n &#39;by wilful taste of what thy self refusest&#39;,\n &#39;i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief&#39;,\n &#39;although thou steal thee all my poverty&#39;,\n &#39;and yet love knows it is a greater grief&#39;,\n &#39;to bear greater wrong than hates known injury&#39;,\n &#39;lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows&#39;,\n &#39;kill me with spites yet we must not be foes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;41&#39;,\n &#39;those pretty wrongs that liberty commits&#39;,\n &#39;when i am sometime absent from thy heart&#39;,\n &#39;thy beauty and thy years full well befits&#39;,\n &#39;for still temptation follows where thou art&#39;,\n &#39;gentle thou art and therefore to be won&#39;,\n &#39;beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed&#39;,\n &#39;and when a woman woos what womans son&#39;,\n &#39;will sourly leave her till he have prevailed&#39;,\n &#39;ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear&#39;,\n &#39;and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth&#39;,\n &#39;who lead thee in their riot even there&#39;,\n &#39;where thou art forced to break a twofold truth&#39;,\n &#39;hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee&#39;,\n &#39;thine by thy beauty being false to me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;42&#39;,\n &#39;that thou hast her it is not all my grief&#39;,\n &#39;and yet it may be said i loved her dearly&#39;,\n &#39;that she hath thee is of my wailing chief&#39;,\n &#39;a loss in love that touches me more nearly&#39;,\n &#39;loving offenders thus i will excuse ye&#39;,\n &#39;thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her&#39;,\n &#39;and for my sake even so doth she abuse me&#39;,\n &#39;suffring my friend for my sake to approve her&#39;,\n &#39;if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain&#39;,\n &#39;and losing her my friend hath found that loss&#39;,\n &#39;both find each other and i lose both twain&#39;,\n &#39;and both for my sake lay on me this cross&#39;,\n &#39;but heres the joy my friend and i are one&#39;,\n &#39;sweet flattery then she loves but me alone&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;43&#39;,\n &#39;when most i wink then do mine eyes best see&#39;,\n &#39;for all the day they view things unrespected&#39;,\n &#39;but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee&#39;,\n &#39;and darkly bright are bright in dark directed&#39;,\n &#39;then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright&#39;,\n &#39;how would thy shadows form form happy show&#39;,\n &#39;to the clear day with thy much clearer light&#39;,\n &#39;when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so&#39;,\n &#39;how would i say mine eyes be blessed made&#39;,\n &#39;by looking on thee in the living day&#39;,\n &#39;when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade&#39;,\n &#39;through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay&#39;,\n &#39;all days are nights to see till i see thee&#39;,\n &#39;and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;44&#39;,\n &#39;if the dull substance of my flesh were thought&#39;,\n &#39;injurious distance should not stop my way&#39;,\n &#39;for then despite of space i would be brought&#39;,\n &#39;from limits far remote where thou dost stay&#39;,\n &#39;no matter then although my foot did stand&#39;,\n &#39;upon the farthest earth removed from thee&#39;,\n &#39;for nimble thought can jump both sea and land&#39;,\n &#39;as soon as think the place where he would be&#39;,\n &#39;but ah thought kills me that i am not thought&#39;,\n &#39;to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone&#39;,\n &#39;but that so much of earth and water wrought&#39;,\n &#39;i must attend times leisure with my moan&#39;,\n &#39;receiving nought by elements so slow&#39;,\n &#39;but heavy tears badges of eithers woe&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;45&#39;,\n &#39;the other two slight air and purging fire&#39;,\n &#39;are both with thee wherever i abide&#39;,\n &#39;the first my thought the other my desire&#39;,\n &#39;these presentabsent with swift motion slide&#39;,\n &#39;for when these quicker elements are gone&#39;,\n &#39;in tender embassy of love to thee&#39;,\n &#39;my life being made of four with two alone&#39;,\n &#39;sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy&#39;,\n &#39;until lifes composition be recured&#39;,\n &#39;by those swift messengers returned from thee&#39;,\n &#39;who even but now come back again assured&#39;,\n &#39;of thy fair health recounting it to me&#39;,\n &#39;this told i joy but then no longer glad&#39;,\n &#39;i send them back again and straight grow sad&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;46&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye and heart are at a mortal war&#39;,\n &#39;how to divide the conquest of thy sight&#39;,\n &#39;mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar&#39;,\n &#39;my heart mine eye the freedom of that right&#39;,\n &#39;my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie&#39;,\n &#39;a closet never pierced with crystal eyes&#39;,\n &#39;but the defendant doth that plea deny&#39;,\n &#39;and says in him thy fair appearance lies&#39;,\n &#39;to side this title is impanelled&#39;,\n &#39;a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart&#39;,\n &#39;and by their verdict is determined&#39;,\n &#39;the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part&#39;,\n &#39;as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part&#39;,\n &#39;and my hearts right thy inward love of heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;47&#39;,\n &#39;betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took&#39;,\n &#39;and each doth good turns now unto the other&#39;,\n &#39;when that mine eye is famished for a look&#39;,\n &#39;or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother&#39;,\n &#39;with my loves picture then my eye doth feast&#39;,\n &#39;and to the painted banquet bids my heart&#39;,\n &#39;another time mine eye is my hearts guest&#39;,\n &#39;and in his thoughts of love doth share a part&#39;,\n &#39;so either by thy picture or my love&#39;,\n &#39;thy self away art present still with me&#39;,\n &#39;for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move&#39;,\n &#39;and i am still with them and they with thee&#39;,\n &#39;or if they sleep thy picture in my sight&#39;,\n &#39;awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;48&#39;,\n &#39;how careful was i when i took my way&#39;,\n &#39;each trifle under truest bars to thrust&#39;,\n &#39;that to my use it might unused stay&#39;,\n &#39;from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust&#39;,\n &#39;but thou to whom my jewels trifles are&#39;,\n &#39;most worthy comfort now my greatest grief&#39;,\n &#39;thou best of dearest and mine only care&#39;,\n &#39;art left the prey of every vulgar thief&#39;,\n &#39;thee have i not locked up in any chest&#39;,\n &#39;save where thou art not though i feel thou art&#39;,\n &#39;within the gentle closure of my breast&#39;,\n &#39;from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part&#39;,\n &#39;and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear&#39;,\n &#39;for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;49&#39;,\n &#39;against that time if ever that time come&#39;,\n &#39;when i shall see thee frown on my defects&#39;,\n &#39;when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum&#39;,\n &#39;called to that audit by advised respects&#39;,\n &#39;against that time when thou shalt strangely pass&#39;,\n &#39;and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye&#39;,\n &#39;when love converted from the thing it was&#39;,\n &#39;shall reasons find of settled gravity&#39;,\n &#39;against that time do i ensconce me here&#39;,\n &#39;within the knowledge of mine own desert&#39;,\n &#39;and this my hand against my self uprear&#39;,\n &#39;to guard the lawful reasons on thy part&#39;,\n &#39;to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws&#39;,\n &#39;since why to love i can allege no cause&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;50&#39;,\n &#39;how heavy do i journey on the way&#39;,\n &#39;when what i seek my weary travels end&#39;,\n &#39;doth teach that case and that repose to say&#39;,\n &#39;thus far the miles are measured from thy friend&#39;,\n &#39;the beast that bears me tired with my woe&#39;,\n &#39;plods dully on to bear that weight in me&#39;,\n &#39;as if by some instinct the wretch did know&#39;,\n &#39;his rider loved not speed being made from thee&#39;,\n &#39;the bloody spur cannot provoke him on&#39;,\n &#39;that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide&#39;,\n &#39;which heavily he answers with a groan&#39;,\n &#39;more sharp to me than spurring to his side&#39;,\n &#39;for that same groan doth put this in my mind&#39;,\n &#39;my grief lies onward and my joy behind&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;51&#39;,\n &#39;thus can my love excuse the slow offence&#39;,\n &#39;of my dull bearer when from thee i speed&#39;,\n &#39;from where thou art why should i haste me thence&#39;,\n &#39;till i return of posting is no need&#39;,\n &#39;o what excuse will my poor beast then find&#39;,\n &#39;when swift extremity can seem but slow&#39;,\n &#39;then should i spur though mounted on the wind&#39;,\n &#39;in winged speed no motion shall i know&#39;,\n &#39;then can no horse with my desire keep pace&#39;,\n &#39;therefore desire of perfectst love being made&#39;,\n &#39;shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race&#39;,\n &#39;but love for love thus shall excuse my jade&#39;,\n &#39;since from thee going he went wilfulslow&#39;,\n &#39;towards thee ill run and give him leave to go&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;52&#39;,\n &#39;so am i as the rich whose blessed key&#39;,\n &#39;can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure&#39;,\n &#39;the which he will not every hour survey&#39;,\n &#39;for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare&#39;,\n &#39;since seldom coming in that long year set&#39;,\n &#39;like stones of worth they thinly placed are&#39;,\n &#39;or captain jewels in the carcanet&#39;,\n &#39;so is the time that keeps you as my chest&#39;,\n &#39;or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide&#39;,\n &#39;to make some special instant specialblest&#39;,\n &#39;by new unfolding his imprisoned pride&#39;,\n &#39;blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope&#39;,\n &#39;being had to triumph being lacked to hope&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;53&#39;,\n &#39;what is your substance whereof are you made&#39;,\n &#39;that millions of strange shadows on you tend&#39;,\n &#39;since every one hath every one one shade&#39;,\n &#39;and you but one can every shadow lend&#39;,\n &#39;describe adonis and the counterfeit&#39;,\n &#39;is poorly imitated after you&#39;,\n &#39;on helens cheek all art of beauty set&#39;,\n &#39;and you in grecian tires are painted new&#39;,\n &#39;speak of the spring and foison of the year&#39;,\n &#39;the one doth shadow of your beauty show&#39;,\n &#39;the other as your bounty doth appear&#39;,\n &#39;and you in every blessed shape we know&#39;,\n &#39;in all external grace you have some part&#39;,\n &#39;but you like none none you for constant heart&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;54&#39;,\n &#39;o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem&#39;,\n &#39;by that sweet ornament which truth doth give&#39;,\n &#39;the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem&#39;,\n &#39;for that sweet odour which doth in it live&#39;,\n &#39;the canker blooms have full as deep a dye&#39;,\n &#39;as the perfumed tincture of the roses&#39;,\n &#39;hang on such thorns and play as wantonly&#39;,\n &#39;when summers breath their masked buds discloses&#39;,\n &#39;but for their virtue only is their show&#39;,\n &#39;they live unwooed and unrespected fade&#39;,\n &#39;die to themselves sweet roses do not so&#39;,\n &#39;of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made&#39;,\n &#39;and so of you beauteous and lovely youth&#39;,\n &#39;when that shall fade my verse distills your truth&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;55&#39;,\n &#39;not marble nor the gilded monuments&#39;,\n &#39;of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme&#39;,\n &#39;but you shall shine more bright in these contents&#39;,\n &#39;than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time&#39;,\n &#39;when wasteful war shall statues overturn&#39;,\n &#39;and broils root out the work of masonry&#39;,\n &#39;nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn&#39;,\n &#39;the living record of your memory&#39;,\n &#39;gainst death and alloblivious enmity&#39;,\n &#39;shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room&#39;,\n &#39;even in the eyes of all posterity&#39;,\n &#39;that wear this world out to the ending doom&#39;,\n &#39;so till the judgment that your self arise&#39;,\n &#39;you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;56&#39;,\n &#39;sweet love renew thy force be it not said&#39;,\n &#39;thy edge should blunter be than appetite&#39;,\n &#39;which but today by feeding is allayed&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow sharpened in his former might&#39;,\n &#39;so love be thou although today thou fill&#39;,\n &#39;thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness&#39;,\n &#39;tomorrow see again and do not kill&#39;,\n &#39;the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness&#39;,\n &#39;let this sad interim like the ocean be&#39;,\n &#39;which parts the shore where two contracted new&#39;,\n &#39;come daily to the banks that when they see&#39;,\n &#39;return of love more blest may be the view&#39;,\n &#39;or call it winter which being full of care&#39;,\n &#39;makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;57&#39;,\n &#39;being your slave what should i do but tend&#39;,\n &#39;upon the hours and times of your desire&#39;,\n &#39;i have no precious time at all to spend&#39;,\n &#39;nor services to do till you require&#39;,\n &#39;nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour&#39;,\n &#39;whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you&#39;,\n &#39;nor think the bitterness of absence sour&#39;,\n &#39;when you have bid your servant once adieu&#39;,\n &#39;nor dare i question with my jealous thought&#39;,\n &#39;where you may be or your affairs suppose&#39;,\n &#39;but like a sad slave stay and think of nought&#39;,\n &#39;save where you are how happy you make those&#39;,\n &#39;so true a fool is love that in your will&#39;,\n &#39;though you do any thing he thinks no ill&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;58&#39;,\n &#39;that god forbid that made me first your slave&#39;,\n &#39;i should in thought control your times of pleasure&#39;,\n &#39;or at your hand th account
